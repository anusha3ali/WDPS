Popular Posts. Categories. Friends. Sitemeter. AdSense. Word Count Statistics. Posted by clay in Christ and culture Discipleship 6 Comments. I’m on vacation this week so I’m posting some older articles. Hope you enjoy this one. You ever think about what is in your back yard Might seem like a bit of an odd question but it’s one that’s been on my mind recently. It’s really pretty easy for me to answer. We’ve got a fort for the kids to play on a slide and a little house for the younger ones some lawn furniture a grill and a small patio. Seems pretty typical doesn’t it. Now if I just stopped there this would make for a pretty pointless and stupid post so I’m not going to. What’s interesting to me are the things that I didn’t describe that are back there things that I don’t expect or want you to see. We have a new dog that’s still a bit of a puppy and she likes to drag things out the dog door and into the backyard. She doesn’t typically chew them up for shoes she just takes them outside and deposits them between the fort and the back door. One day my wife and I were talking while I was driving home from work and she said look in the back yard when you get home. Naturally I was curious why I was being restricted like this and she replied with it looks like a diaper bomb went off out there. Apparently Maggie had found a trash can in the bedroom where we had been putting diapers and was taking them outside one by one. Now you might be wondering why I’m telling you about this and how it relates to my point. You really need to be less like my son watching a movie constantly asking about what’s going to happen and be more patient. I’m only 250 words into this. When there is stuff strewn all over the back yard I hate going out there. It’s surrounded by a fence so nobody sees it and this removes just about any motivation I might have to clean it up. I don’t even like mowing out there. Normally nobody knows about this except for my family and it’s not a big deal. However last week anyone driving by my house knew about my lack of back yard cleanliness. After a couple days of strong winds and one good storm my already pathetic fence gave up on one side of the house and came crashing down. I look outside during the storm and notice three fence panels on the ground and two more waving like fans at a football game who just realized the camera was turned their direction. I was understandably disappointed that I would have to repair the fence but I was more disturbed that now people would be able to see into my back yard and the sorry state it was in. Last weekend while I was rebuilding the fence I had plenty of time to think. I started to realize that the way we maintain our house could really be a metaphor for our own lives. I try to make sure that the front yard is fairly well kept always mowed and looking at least presentable. The front yard is like my public life. It’s lived out in front of anyone who can see it and what goes on there isn’t hidden in the least. Any words I speak in public are out there for all to hear. My back yard is a bit more guarded. I try to keep what is going on back there private but it doesn’t always work as evidenced by my fence falling in. Just like that fence sometimes my guard is down and people see a bit more of what I’m really like. I might try to quickly build the fence back up but once someone sees that back yard of my personality they probably won’t forget it especially if it contradicts what I normally do. My point behind all this is that we need to be sure that what we display in the front yard of our lives our public face is consistent with how we live in the back yard of our life. We expect privacy there but we should also understand that at any moment that privacy can be broken and all the things that we try to hide from public view will be displayed for all to see. Luke 12:2-3 tells us. 2 For there is nothing covered that will not be revealed nor hidden that will not be known. 3 Therefore whatever you have spoken in the dark will be heard in the light and what you have spoken in the ear in inner rooms will be proclaimed on the housetops. Let us live our lives so that what is proclaimed from the housetops is our love for our Savior our dedication to living our lives for the calling He has given to us. We are the light of the world shining like that city on a hill to make known His sacrifice for us not for our own glory but for His. Pray that we do not let the hidden part of our lives become a hindrance to the spreading of His word. 6 Comments. Did Collette tell you about the state of our backyard Hmm.. good post.

The journey from your mind into your hands is shorter than you’re thinking. Be careful if you think you stand you just might be sinking. Fade” Casting Crowns. The hard thing about trying to be a good moral person is that you’re constantly being pulled towards those things you know you shouldn’t be involved in. Temptation has a way of dragging you back onto the wide path when you’ve been trying to walk the straight and narrow. Sometimes though you make the choices yourself. You see that someone else is letting slide what you think is wrong so you begin to think it’s OK too. It could be swearing movies drinking just about anything. You start to feel pressure if you’re the one that is different from everyone else and then you begin to conform to the ways of those around you. And do not be conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God. Romans 12:2 The little things add up all the time. First you decide to tell a little white lie so that you don’t get in trouble. You follow those with lies to cover up the original lie. Years later you’re telling your spouse that you’ve been at the office all day when really you’ve been at a bar all because it’s become more natural to lie than to tell the truth. Opening the door to any sin allows all sin to get a foothold in your life. We’ve got to battle back sin with the Holy Spirit actively engaging in the fight and not passively allowing the enemy to roll over us. This is something that doesn’t come natural to any of us it really is a struggle to do. However the reward for fighting back the sin in our lives is eternal. Imagine that a worker notices a problem with a dam holding back millions of gallons of water. Below that dam is a quaint little town full of people going about their everyday lives. If the worker notices a small leak in the dam should he fix the leak or should he just say it’s just a small leak it should be fine. Those millions of gallons of water are now placing pressure on that small leak causing it to grow a little bigger with each passing day. Gradually the leak turns into a gaping hole allowing more water to pass through causing some minor issues in the little town. Still the worker says dam is still standing that hole isn’t causing much damage. I’ll ignore it.. Eventually the gaping hole gives way to an actual dam break. Millions of gallons of water are rushing down the hill towards the little town destroying everything in its path. The little town is destroyed all the people are injured or killed and the dam worker justifies it by saying dam just broke!. Now let’s talk about sin this way. Maybe you’ve allowed a little sin into your life but you don’t want to deal with it because it’s not a big deal. Everyone has small issues right Your family doesn’t know about it and everything looks normal. However that sin is placing pressure on you and on the rest of your life wanting to allow more sin to come through. Gradually that sin grows into something that you and your family notice but you don’t really identify the cause of the problem. You continue to justify it by saying that everyone is doing it it’ll be OK. It’s not causing too many problems in your life so you just let it continue. Finally the dam breaks. You act out on your sin in a big way destroying your family your reputation and your relationship with God. You might say don’t know what happened I wasn’t myself it just happened!. This is what happens when we allow sin to erode our life. Our familiarity with sin is unacceptable to God. We cannot be friendly with sin and friendly with God at the same time. Through prayer through devotion to Him God can give us the ability to overcome sin but we have to make the effort to do so. We have to pursue God so that He can renew our minds. Are there areas where you need to battle back sin in your life How can I pray for you.

Word Count Statistics. Posted by clay in Christ and culture Writing 0 Comments. It’s been quite a week. We have one more night here at Walt Disney World then we are headed home. I’ll give you a bit of a preview for next week though. There are a few things I’ve noticed here that develop into great analogies for life lessons. Anything from a large burly fellow with a pink Disney Princess backpack to using the bathroom at the dinner table to the lack of wisdom in crowds. I think you’ll enjoy these. However today I’d like to share with a you a few lessons that have been forcefully taught to me this week. Some painful some really painful and some rather enjoyable. I love that I’ve been able to spend a week in a single hotel room with my wife and kids. However I’m going crazy spending a week in a single hotel room with my kids. Bedtime is the absolute craziest time of day. I don’t know if it is the tired children the tired parents or the insanity of being in one room but little ones do not go to sleep well this way at least not ours. Now this is a very first world problem and I know that I should be thankful that I’m able to take trips like this with my children. Don’t misunderstand me because I am very thankful for that. The simple fact remains that it is so far out of the ordinary for us as to be uncomfortable and even more tiring. The second thing I’ve learned is that you can tell how many days people have been here just by the look on their faces. There is an unspoken sat through A Small World so many times that i might just twist off at the next puppet I see look to some faces. These are the people that are not hardcore Disney fans but came mostly for their children. aside you know what would make World so much better Bucket o softballs. You’ll have to create a queue that would stretch all the way across the park for it. So many childhood doll nightmares erased in a hail of tossed balls. It’s a goldmine. I expect my royalty checks to pour in soon.. Too many people come here with the expectation that they can accomplish everything at WDW in a week. This is so far from the truth. My wife and I have been coming here since 1996 and we’ve still not seen or done it all. The likelihood is pretty slim that it will happen too. Too many things changing or disappearing to be able to conquer that mountain. The one lasting memory I have from our trips to WDW is the sense of awe that my children feel. Heck I feel it too. Everything here is so much bigger so much more perfect than the real world. Of course if it weren’t that way we wouldn’t be paying to visit. If someone built a Computer Progeammer World I’d have to be drugged to be taken in to it. I don’t want my real life I want a different reality. That might be good sometimes but it definitely isn’t a way to live. Finally it appears to me that while they are here people become a clearer more exact picture of themselves due to the money and time spent and emotional and physical investment paid to be here. Vacations especially big ones like WDW have a way of refining our personalities in a way that other experiences don’t. I’ve seen adults act like complete children and complete jerks. I’ve seen children be perfect angels and ceaseless terrors you should have seen everyone else’s kids too. I’m sure that I exhibit some of this too. We are who we are and exhaustion makes the pretensions go away. All in all it’s been a great time here. I”m anxious to start home and return to my own reality though. Too many exciting things coming up in the next few weeks that I don’t want to miss. I hope you come back again next week for my Observations on the World series.

Iâ€TMve talked about this before the miraculous discovery that my kitchen-aid paddle attachment will shred chicken.Â No more forks and aching hands.Â Throw it in\,Â chop it up and youâ€TMre done. But just in case you don’t believe me because it definitely sounds too good to be true\,Â hereâ€TMs the proof. Boil the chicken.Â Remove from pan and place on cutting board. Cut chicken breasts into halves.Â I don’t know if you absolutely have to do this but I did. Put the chicken in the kitchen-aid bowl with the paddle attachment. ProcessÂ the chicken for about 45 seconds on low speed.Â And there you have it beautifully shredded chicken in a fraction of the time it takes with two forks.Â If I hadn’t seen it with my own eyes I wouldn’t have believed it. I have a friend who has a stand-up mixer that isn’t a Kitchen-Aid.Â Her mixer has two beaters instead of one paddle.Â She tried shredding her chicken with her mixer and it worked just fine. So next time you need shredded chicken skip the forks and use your Kitchen-Aid.Â It’s a miracle!!. You might also like I Love My Kitchen-Aid Shredded BBQ Chicken Sandwiches Fries Green Beans.

This is a really good recipe one of my favorites but it does take a little time.Â Itâ€TMs not hard the steak just has to cook for a while. That being said I made this once in the crock pot and it turned out just as good.Â Iâ€TMll provide crock pot directions at the end in case you want to try it that way. Cut meat in serving-sized pieces.Â Coat with flour.Â In a large covered skillet melt the margarine and brown meat slowly on both sides. Add tomatoes salt basil and pepper.Â Cover and simmer one hour. Add onions and green pepper.Â Cook 30 more minutes or until meat is tender.Â Top meat with cheese.Â Heat until cheese melts. You can either brown the meat in the skillet or skip that step itâ€TMs up to you.Â Either way works.Â I did not brown my meat in the skillet.Â In my opinion that eliminates some of the benefit of the crock pot. I just want to throw everything in and be done with it. Grease your crock pot with pam.Â Mix the tomatoes salt basil pepper onions and green pepper together. Layer as follows.

Warehouse shopping such as at Costco and Sam’s can be a great way to save money but it can also lead to the destruction of a good grocery budget. It all depends on how you shop there. First let’s look at the cost and benefits of a membership. A membership to Samâ€TMs costs $40 or $100 per year depending on the type of membership you chose. The Advantage membership is $40 and allows for 2 cardholders and the ability to purchase products in-store and online. The Advantage Plus is $100 and allows for 2 card holders extended shopping hours extra coupons and a percentage of savings on generic and name brand prescriptions. Costo’s membership ranges from $55-$110 per year. The Gold Star membership is $55 and allows for 2 card holders extra coupons mailed to you monthly and the ability to purchase in-store and online. The Executive Gold Star membership is $110 and allows for 2 card holders extra coupons in the mail and 2 cash back on all purchases throughout the year. You will get a check at the end of the year for your percentage back. If the total does not equal $55 you can take your check in and they will refund the difference. Outside the normal expected goods at warehouses they also have excellent competitive prices on prescriptions tires contact lenses glasses and much more. Throughout the year you can find excellent prices on toys books clothing Halloween costumes movies and CDs and specialty items. Our family has a membership to Costco and we figured out that if we only bought milk there regularly we would pay for our membership 2.5x in a year with the amount we save. And now I want to tell you the secret to saving at warehouses. Are you listening very closely It’s all about what you buy and knowing your prices. Just because something is sold at a warehouse does NOT mean itâ€TMs a better deal than your neighborhood grocery store. You must look at the unit price to see if it’s a better deal. If you aren’t familiar with that term unit price is figured by calculating the total price times the number of items the package contains. I often pull out my calculator and check unit prices while I’m at Costco to compare it to what I know the grocery store price is to see if it’s a better deal. Some people hesitate to shop at warehouses because the quantities are often so large. If you have room in your pantry or freezer and your family will consume something in reasonable time then it might be well worth it. Another way to get around the large quantity is going in with a friend to split the purchase. My sister-in-law and I have shared huge packages of toilet paper fruit and other things to help us both with our budgets and storage space. Bottom line:Â when you’re warehouse shopping go with a list and a set amount to spend and stick with it. This week’s challenge. If youâ€TMre a warehouse member try calculating this week to see if what you are buying is really a better deal than the grocery store. If you aren’t already a member ask a friend who is if you can accompany them. Sometimes you can also get a guest pass for a day to out a membership.

Don't worry everyone's favorite Ron Paul is still doing just dandy—but according to MSNBC a group of anti-poaching conservationists in South Africa accidentally killed the real rhinoceros they were using to demonstrate how to protects rhinos from poachers. The 20-year-old rhino named Spencer was shot with a tranquilizer gun in front of a crowd of reporters by members of the Rhino Rescue Project who were documenting a process used to identify protected animals and deter poachers from killing them for their horns. After he was tranquilized Spencer's horn was to be treated with a dye and an insecticide and a tracking device was going to be inserted as well. Unfortunately Spencer never woke up rhino had an unfortunate reaction to the anesthesia\, said Rhino Rescue Project spokeswoman Lorinda Hern. time you dart a rhino you take a risk that the rhino might not wake up and unfortunately today was one of those days. Maybe they could have just used life-like sculptures. A record 448 rhinos were killed by poachers last year in South Africa home to the greatest number of the animals. Hern says she blames Spencer's death on those poachers sad for us it's the loss of another animal. It's a death that I still chalk up to poaching. Next time maybe they should take a page from zoo keepers and police at the Ueno Zoo in Tokyo and do all their homework on rhinos before messing with them.

The single mother who was arrested last week and charged with harassing and stalking Yankees general manager Brian Cashman amidst her claims that she had been Cashman's mistress since last April has levied new charges against Cashman. Louise Neathway also goes by the last name Meanwell claimed to the Daily News that Cashman confided in her that he purposefully misled federal investigators about whether Yankees brass knew certain players used steroids. Cashman’s spokesman Chris Giglio vehemently denied the accusations claims are complete and utter fiction the latest installment of a carefully concocted campaign of harassment now spewing from a jail cell by a person who is being held on serious criminal felony charges of harassment and extortion\, Giglio said. Neathway has already sent an email to Ron Gardella chief investigator for the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York and FBI agent Brian Jacob advising them of her claims. In that email she said she had details on dates and times that Cashman was aware of steroid use by players. Neathway has been charged with grand larceny attempted grand larceny stalking and aggravated harassment. Among other things Cashman's lawyers say the 36-year-old British national was an unhinged con woman out to extort him bombarding him with text messages and calls during the past 10 months. She allegedly tried to blackmail him into paying for a $15\,000 medical treatment threatening to contact the press and his family if he didn’t. Cashman says he eventually caved and gave her $6\,000 in different bank accounts before contacting police. Manhattan prosecutors have now subpoenaed Cashman’s bank records—which Post sources say include evidence that he gave her as much as $20\,000 to Neathway—in order to determine whether she truly was extorting him for months or if they were legitimate gifts as part of an affair. Neathway who has 13 orders of protection against her since 1998 has been characterized by her exes as and Neathway claimed Cashman had gotten her pregnant but an ultrasound she emailed him was ultimately proven to be a fake and Neathway's mother said she never pregnant and had lied about it in the past as well. Former boyfriend David Sano told the Post he went through a very similar situation with her a decade ago their relationship started after she claimed she was pregnant after a one-night stand and ended around the time she delivered a sex tape featuring Sano and his former schoolteacher girlfriend to the headmaster of the Christian school where the woman worked. what Louise does\, Sano said. takes pleasure in other people’s pain..

It's the first new nuclear power plant to get a green light from the government since the Three Mile Island meltdown in 1979. Go Isotopes Now nuclear power enthusiasts are spinning this faster than an overheating centrifuge heralding the licensing as the dawn of a new era in nuclear energy. Jim Steets a spokesman for the controversial Indian Point facility just north of New York City tells CBS 880 positive news for the industry and I think the benefits of nuclear power are clear. It certainly makes his job easier for a day or two since the last time Indian Point was in the news the Nuclear Regulatory Commission was rejecting some of the power plant’s fire safety procedures. Governor Cuomo has said that Indian Point should close and the facility has been under increased scrutiny ever since an earthquake in Japan damaged the Fukishima nuclear reactor. Indian Point sits at the intersection of two fault lines and has been branded the most vulnerable to an earthquake in the nation. As for the Georgia plant it goes without saying that not everyone is as sanguine as Indian Point's spokesman. Laura Haight at the New York Public Interest Research Group maintains that financing is almost dead in the water for nuclear power plants. It’s too risky. It’s too expensive. And Allison Fisher an energy expert for the consumer advocacy group Public Citizen called the Georgia plant a step in the wrong direction. is inexplicable that we’ve chosen this moment in history to expand the use of a failed and dangerous technology\, Fisher told the Washington Post.

The annual fight over school closures between the city parents teachers—and now Occupiers—returned in full force last night for a raucous crazy meeting at Brooklyn Tech. More than 2\,000 people showed up for an evening the Times describes as being like meetings were going on at once all of them confused and cacophonous with sound spilling over from one group to the next. In the end the Panel for Education Policy voted to close or partially close the 23 schools they announced in December. And even without Cathie Black to kick around like last year the meeting wasn't the most orderly. are important proposals up for discussion\, current Schools Commissioner Walcott said. all the union wants to do is bus in Occupy Wall Street protesters...then we will just have to work around that. And so they did. Because in addition to the Teachers Union which had originally planned to hold a meeting in a nearby school a group calling themselves Occupy the Department of Education were also on hand to help foster atmosphere that was more chaotic than usual. There was a heavy police presence but the NYPD press office tells us there weren't any arrests. In the end PEP which consists of Walcott and 13 members appointed by the mayor and borough presidents voted to close all the schools on the block it has done every time it has convened. And this was only the beginning. The City is aiming to close 62 schools this year as part of Mayor Bloomberg's educational reform plans. Amid the chanting parents teachers and students spoke to the Panel in the hopes of saving their schools. angry and I’m frustrated. I am afraid for the future of my child’s life\, one mother at the hearing said. Although the panel voted to close the schools many of them will remain open for a few more years as they graduate their current classes and are replaced by smaller schools. Since Bloomberg became mayor the city has opened 396 schools and closed 117 some overlap. Despite the crazy crowds last night's hearing actually broke tradition and didn't actually go on for very long. After about two hours 2\,500-seat auditorium began to empty out as the Occupy members reacted to an unconfirmed report that the police were about to make arrests and parents and students gave up on trying to speak..

TIGA Independent Game Developersâ€TM Association has been fighting with the UK government over tax breaks for the gaming industry. According to the New York Times video game makers straddle the lines between software development the entertainment industry and online retailing they can combine tax breaks in ways that companies like Netflix and Adobe cannot.â But this isnâ€TMt the case in the UK meaning that many UK developers are emigrating heading to countries which provide those types of incentives. Rocksteady designer Sefton Hill has described this as a talent-drain for the UK gaming industry. In an interview with CVG Hill was asked whether or not he thought the UK could be competitive with countries like the US with regard to gaming. Hill responds that many of his friends have gone abroad to find work. Places like Montreal are hot-spots for development because they have incredible tax breaks. I concede that some video games or even entire video game genres are simply too complex or difficult for certain players to appreciate. Or perhaps some individuals simply dislike lengthy complicated experiences. In some regards I have to admit that games can be major investment and if someone is unwilling to dip past the surface mechanics of a video game then they are entitled to their reservations. In that sense I can rationalize the existence of a game like King Arthur II despite my dislike for games of its philosophy. King Arthur II is obviously the sequel to King Arthur The Roleplaying Wargame a game unique in that it ties together multiple genres into a fairly well executed package. King Arthur II adopts much of its predecessor’s gameplay but also expands upon it slightly. Still this is clearly not as profound a package as a Total War game and it shows through the game’s presentation and gameplay. Welcome to Casual Fridays where we kick back relax and take off our pants. note Guys please leave your pants on. HR has made this very clear. In our newest feature Typing About Games two of the Piki Geek staff face off in a no-holds-bar chat conversation. Beliefs are challenged points are exclaimed hype is harnessed and video games are dissected like insects. Enjoy a look into the discussions that plague the Piki Geek chat day after day. In any argument about whether or not games can be art anything developed by Team Ico Shadow of the Colossus must come up. They are beautiful emotional games with a simple story and overwhelming depth. Itâ€TMs for these reasons that their newest project the Last Guardian has been highly anticipated throughout the six years since the release of Shadow of the Colossus. Fans still gush about the game and come up with buckets of fan-art despite the fact that there havenâ€TMt been any real public updates in three years and reports that director Fumito Ueda had left Sony. However 1UP has thrown us a bone to chew on while we wait for the real prize as they interviewed Sony Worldwide Studios president Shuhei Yoshida about the Last Guardian. First Yoshida wanted to stress that Ueda didnâ€TMt Sony. He isnâ€TMt an employee but he is continuing to work on the Last Guardian as a contractor without any real changes to his presence on the team. He still goes into the office every day working the longest hours. As far as rumors go the suggestion that the new Xbox console will have a built-in touchscreen like the Wii U is one of the least substantiated but we’re hearing it again. Last month GameSpot was discussing the likelihood of the controller prototype and now Xbox World magazine is reporting from their sources that this decision is more than just conjecture. The report in XBW suggests that the controller design is hoping to look more akin to a handheld like the PS Vita rather than a sizable tablet controller like the Wii U. The report describes the design as HD screen surrounded by the traditional 360 buttons and sticks.. If your significant other was bitten by a zombie what would you do Would you kill them and put them out of their misery Or would you cut off their head and use nonexistent technology to keep it alive Personally I would go with number two but that’s just me. Needless to say that is the route that Juliet takes in the new trailer for Suda 51′s upcoming acid trip Lollipop Chainsaw. This trailer introduces the severed head that had been hooked to Juliet’s rear in the previous trailer. Apparently he used have a hot bod before getting bit by a zombie. Afterwards in a truly tear jerking act of love Juliet decapitates him. Along with the gleeful shots of Juliet’s rear the trailer also introduces a few gameplay elements. You’ll be able to use Nick’s head as a weapon as well as attach him to other bodies in order to gain jump boosts.. and up-skirt shots. Head on past the break to check out the trailer. The Splatters by SpikySnail Games is as charming and unique as it is difficult to describe. Itâ€TMs basically a physics-driven puzzler where the goal is to fling sentient balls of paint around in an effort to drench and detonate bomb clusters. After an initial hands-on with the game at PAX last year the development team pretty much went dark not releasing any new info or footage of the game until now. The latest dev diary Outâ€ details the gameâ€TMs flip mechanic a sort of time reversal maneuver that allows your Splatter to fly back in the direction from whence it came. Careful timing is the key to using the flip successfully and looks to add yet another layer of nuance to an already heavily-nuanced game. The Splatters is heading for a tentative Spring release but in the meantime head past the break to check out the newest bit of footage. Frictional Games the masters of indie gaming horror have dropped a hint about their next game supposedly a follow up to their 2010 hit Amnesia The Dark Descent. The teaser site is nothing more than an image that says is emerging\, but clicking on the image takes you to a Google Maps view of China. A horror title set in ancient China Sign me up. Craig Pearson over at Rock Paper Shotgun did some digging and proved the site is indeed real and not the work of a troll trying to get people’s hopes up. What Frictional has up its sleeves is anyone’s guess at this point but if the first Amnesia title was any indication the next game will certainly have gamers screaming in terror as Cthulhian tentacle monsters chase them through dark hallways.

Yup. With less than a month left until the release of Mass Effect 3 eager fans have more reasons to drool every day. Need proof BioWare posted five new videos on their website detailing various aspects of the game including information on a customizable arsenal and smarter enemies. Thereâ€TMs even a few quick shots of FemShep in action for the femme fatale fans. Oh BioWare you know just how to please us. Mass Effect 3 drops on March 6 for Xbox 360 PS3 and PC but hit the break below to satisfy your cravings in the meantime.

Today is the deadline for your biggest campaign pitch all year and Murphyâ€TMs Law is in full effect. You need campaign documents youâ€TMve forgotten on your home desktop a projector that can display at 246 inches with a 2200:1 contrast ratio and a GPS that will inform you of the derailed train blocking the closest highway. This is your life and without the right gadgets and electronics to make it through things like train wrecks go from blocking highways to being how you describe your very existence. These days though the toughest part of getting the right gear is finding it amidst all the clutter and clamor. Half of your search results arenâ€TMt at the top of the list because theyâ€TMre the best product for you thatâ€TMs for sure. There are seedy armies of desk jockeys cramming SEO into everything they write. Half of the reviews youâ€TMll find by very very serious bloggers are five star ratings because they got buttered up by a P.R. rep and their latest plasma TV was free. Youâ€TMd think you could trust Amazon but theyâ€TMre literally putting products in order by what makes them the most money not by what is most relevant to your search. eReaders are a perfect example. They canâ€TMt all be perfect for you right Clearly one is more suited to your desires but how do you know if you’re a Kinde or iPad person This doesn’t even include the hundred other options that are overshadowed by all the marketing. You might never even know their features. Thatâ€TMs where Pikimal enters the fray. Weâ€TMre the Master Blaster to your Thunderdome. Pikimal allows you to define the features and specs that you want/need in a sexy new device. Interested in the biggest television you can get for the lowest price Who isnâ€TMt What about the biggest television with 3 HDMI connections that also streams web content and is light enough for your grandmother to carry We can give you those results that detailed as quickly as you can drag a simple slider from left to right. It’s not as quick as snapping your fingers or clicking your heels but it’s probably as close as you’re going to get. Nothing comes between you and the products that best match your interests and there are no marketing middlemen deciding what sits at the top of the list. So where exactly does Piki Geek fit in all this With knowledge of the Pikimal tool and the Pikis for all sorts of electronics weâ€TMre the guys with a healthy possibly unhealthy passion for technology and gadgetry. From which tablet PC can best display Porntube to which eReader has the finest selection of classic literature novels) this is where youâ€TMll find the information weâ€TMve pulled from Pikimal on the best products and who should be stoked about them news on upcoming tech and an extra double shot of ridiculously caffeinated geeky passion to wash it all down. Letâ€TMs be clear weâ€TMre not another set of guys reviewing the free Xbox 360s that Microsoft gives out at press conferences. Weâ€TMre pulling from the hard unchangeable facts and product specs collected by the coding geniuses Pikimal which cut through the hype and other marketing techniques that can cloud your judgment. There’s nothing old school about the latest generation of electronics so why are we still searching for buying!. products like it’s 1998 Letâ€TMs recap. The savvy consumer is out there wading through all the online muck and then visiting stores to get hands-on time with products and before long purchasing a digital camera has taken a solid month. Pikimal is the new school and it’s in a class of its own. Weâ€TMre streamlining your shopping decisions by hitting you with the facts and none of the spiel. Officially the game is changed. Feel free to text your friends and let them know or follow us on Twitter for quality tech-obsessed conversation. We’ve got geeks behind the scenes and weâ€TMll be putting you in touch with the robot alarm clock youâ€TMve always wanted the speakers that will rattle your nose hairs and the rest of your geek passions on a silver motherboard platter. Mostly we’ll keep your eyes affixed to the electronics you’re looking for and the train that is your life will happily remain on its tracks.

Before we plunge headlong into the depths of tech specs and unyielding geek passion we thought it best to introduce our siblings to anyone who might find that their interests while surely geeky also veer into some other captivating specialties. Pikimal is currently the mother/father figure to three blogs which we are proudly one. Outside of Piki Geek weâ€TMre happy to announce that Piki Eat has recently launched and Piki Parenting is gearing up to bring baby mommas all the child rearing and product knowledge they could possibly need. Weâ€TMre proud to be in the company of experts like Daniel Stuchel the Foodie Prime behind Piki Eat and Kari DePhillips the Piki Parenting Master of Mom-hood. Weâ€TMve collected experts like these inundated them with the Piki interface and then set them free to engage their passions via their blogs. You know just like we do for the denizens of the geek world. With these three blogs in tow Pikimal is starting up by helping you make the best decisions of your life. What food you put in your mouth where your baby sleeps and whether or not you need a surround sound receiver with 9.2 channel support and 1080p video upconversion. Equally important right.

Featured Article. 5 More of The Worst Trends From This Console Generation. Featured Articles. Latest News. About. Legal issues are pretty common in this industry and for the most part they’re over miniscule things. In this case that is the trademark of the acronym DOTA. Blizzard recently filed a complaint against Valve in an attempt to gain control of DOTA and all related names. DOTA or Defense of the Anicents began as a mod in Blizzard’s popular RTS Warcraft 3. Valve became interested in making DOTA 2 after corresponding with Icefrog DOTA’s original developer and inviting him to the Valve offices. Soon after they filed a trademark for DOTA so that they could begin work on the sequel. Meanwhile Blizzard is in the midst of creating a Blizzard DOTA for Starcraft 2. From the court documents. DOTA has been used as the popular name of a Warcraft III software file that has been distributed marketed and promoted by Blizzard and its fans license from Blizzard) that utilizes and is built upon the Warcraft III game engine interface and gameplay mechanics that is comprised of Warcraft III characters items spells artwork textures and color palates that can be played only using Warcraft III software and via Blizzard’s online service Battle.net and whose name an acronym for of the Ancients” is a reference to Warcraft III characters known as the Warcraft III’s EULA clearly specifies that all underlying intellectual property rights in and to Warcraft III are owned by Blizzard title ownership rights and intellectual property rights in and to the Program and any and all copies thereof but not limited to any titles computer code themes objects characters character names stories dialog catch phrases locations concepts artwork animations sounds musical compositions audiovisual effects methods of operation moral rights any related documentation and incorporated into the Program are owned by Blizzard or its licensors. What does everything think about this Do you think Blizzard has valid claims for the ownership of the title Or should it go to Valve and Icefrog Speak up in the comments What does everything think about this Do you think Blizzard has valid claims for the ownership of the title Or should it go to Valve and Icefrog Speak up in the comments. I’m pretty sure Valve laid claim to the 2′ name by using it as an acronym stripped of the acronymity thus making it a legitimate name that doesn’t mean anything. They said as much here http://pc.ign.com/articles/114/1143122p1.html. It’s a bit flimsy but it’s a valid legal defence that has a modicum of weight.

The teaser site is nothing more than an image that says is emerging\, but clicking on the image takes you to a Google Maps view of China. A horror title set in ancient China Sign me up. Craig Pearson over at Rock Paper Shotgun did some digging and proved the site is indeed real and not the work of a troll trying to get people’s hopes up. What Frictional has up its sleeves is anyone’s guess at this point but if the first Amnesia title was any indication the next game will certainly have gamers screaming in terror as Cthulhian tentacle monsters chase them through dark hallways.

To see the impact color has on the overall user experience of a website one need onlyÂ strip away a hue to see how the visual flow is affected. While color creates the mood and feel of the site byÂ directing user attention to certain elements there are many ways to approach the use of color. Hue value and saturation are all three integrated dimensions of color that when used properly can enhance the siteâ€TMs message just as well\,Â if not better than using flashy colors. In this article weâ€TMll delve deeper into color psychology as it relates to web design and view examples of sites that used color persuasively in their branding efforts. For a primer on color one should refer to the color wheel as it presents a logically arranged sequence of pure hues. Iâ€TMm sure youâ€TMre familiar with the primaries red yellow and blue and secondaries:Â green orange and purple which are formed by mixing the primaries. Tertiary colors are comprised of the middle colors like yellow-green and blue-green. They are created by mixing a primary color and a secondary color. We often refer to the color wheel as it can be used to create harmonious color schemes leading to an effective visual experience. The two most popular advertising color choices in America\,Â blue and red\,Â are frequently used on websites globally. Blue connotes trustworthiness loyalty and sincerity and is most often a business favorite due to these attributes. But blue isnâ€TMt for everyone and the best method of determining the right color colors for your brand or website is to first consider the target group you’re trying to reach. Colors have different meanings to various age groups cultures and nationalities. TheyÂ have the power to reach beyond just connotations and hold the viewerâ€TMs attention communicate what the business is about and make a sale. When you think of the impact color has on a particular audience itâ€TMs easy to see why companies exert a lot of time and effort in choosing the right one. A common solution for drawing attention to monochromatic links is to give them a faint background to lift them off the page. This technique is shown in the navigation for AppZapper. The active link on the navigation for Font Explorer is styled differently than the rest giving the user a quick glimpse at where they are on the website. Bronto uses saturated colors to bring attention toÂ its navigation. This balance works well with the rest of the site which is more subdued yet takes up more screen real estate. Postbox uses red and blue onÂ its call to-action buttons. These highly saturated and large buttons do a great jobÂ of drawing attention to the intended action the user should take toÂ download or buy the software. Compare how the less-saturated button just below and to the right would fare if those buttons switched colors. The complimentary color of blue is used on the call-to-action button on Live Resto to set it apart on the layout and add emphasis. The minimal clean website for Billings makes use of vibrant blue headings for emphasis. A Small Orange makes use ofÂ its brand colors inÂ the list of recent news posts. The color doesnâ€TMt overwhelm as itâ€TMs used sparingly with a white background to ease its vibrancy. If the text on your site is meant for scanning instead of reading itâ€TMs okay to have gray text on a black background. On the website for VersionsApp the monotony is broken up through highlighting and the use of splashes of color throughout the text. Sometimes the best solution is to have dark text on a white background. Readability is hardly a problem with this method. When necessary you can incorporate color into quotes or bullet points as shown hereÂ for Crazy Egg. We should also think of color in terms of accessibility for color-blind users. After all these color deficiencies affect about 8 of males and 0.5 of females. The great thing about designing for this niche is good design judgment is really all it takes. For instance donâ€TMt use colors with similar brightness values as the base of your website. This causes the text to vibrate and can lead to watery eyes. Also if youâ€TMre going to use a change in background color to designate a hover state make sure it has enough contrast and is different in its relative brightness. It’sÂ alsoÂ a good idea to add another design element such as a stroke to a button when this hover is activated providing further contrast. The call-to-action buttons on the website for Notify feature a contrasting outer glow stroke when the user hovers over them. Such small details add contrast to the button. Weâ€TMre past the era of web design where we have to use as many flashy colors as possible to grab the userâ€TMs attention. Thankfully weâ€TMve developed insight into how we can convey a message using shades of one color. The use of monochromatic color in layouts is a common practice for designers who want to portray a balanced interface while focusing on the overall UX instead of merely coloring things up. As youâ€TMll see by the following examples itâ€TMs possible to create an engaging and informed layout by simply using one color. The Invoice Machine uses a grayscale for the design ofÂ its invoicing softwareâ€TMs website. Blue the common color for links is used as a border around the buttons emphasizing their importance in relation to the rest of the site. This makes the buttons stand outÂ without resultingÂ in a bubbly 3-D look. Davroc Interiors creates a soothing visual experience on its website. Hover over the photographs to reveal full-color images that add a layer of interest to the minimal website. Blue the universal link color is used in areas throughout the site to enhance the user experience. Metelab also uses a monochromatic color scheme onÂ its website. Notice the use of saturation on the top-right button. Saturated colors are effective on buttons links alerts and system messages because they grab the userâ€TMs attention. Itâ€TMs important to use these colors sparingly as too many can slow the user down. When used correctly saturation can be exciting and dynamic. Gray is a common color used in web design these days because it doesnâ€TMt compete with saturated and desaturated colors. The absence of color on The Grid System site is a great opportunity to make use of white space and bold typography when necessary. Such elements help create hierarchy by grouping elements together according to importance. There may be millions of colors out there and as a designer my goal is to choose those that speak to my clientâ€TMs business and mission. While some companies adopt color as a tool to enhance dynamism others are put off by it when used sporadically. Through the examples Iâ€TMve shown in this article I hope to strike a balance between these extremes one where color can be used in all its vibrancy but still be elegant and alternative approaches to the use of color such as the monochromatic color scheme.

What’s Your Type The 5-Step Guide to Finding the Right Font. 4 Unique Ways to Increase Email Marketing Conversion Rates. Why do you do what you do. One of the ways we decide what to do is to find out what others are doing. You know like when you’reÂ in a restaurant and you don’t know what to order. It’s easy to say\,Â have what he’s having.. It’s called proof.”Â Social proof is one of Dr. Robert Cialdini’s five laws of influence. And it’s a powerful one. Dr. Cialdini reminds us that advertisers incessantly remind us that their products areÂ the selling orÂ growing”Â to imply that are doing it soÂ why aren’t you?. Bartenders their tip jar with a $10 bill to increase tips. Sitcoms provide laugh tracks to activate our deep-rooted instincts to do what others are doing in this case\,Â laughing. On the web customer testimonials have proven to be a high-impact method for increasing web conversions. But all testimonials are not created equal. Sure putting any authentic testimonial on your website is likely to lift conversions. But if you apply the three tips below testimonials can provide a tremendous lift in web conversions. Make a list of every reason a prospect would not purchase your product or service. Now gather at least one testimonial that overcomes each objection. For instance Jane sells website design services. She often hears from customers that they don’t want to rebuild their website because they aren’t sure if they will ever recover the cost of redesigning. A testimonial like this ought to do the trick. redesigned my website with Jane and recovered my money the first six months of having my new website. Now it’s all positive ROI. It was the best investment I made this year.. And Jane also receives sales objections from prospects whoÂ thinkÂ redesigning a web site will be too time-intensive.Â Gathering a testimonial like this one should calm their nerves. website design process was so simple. She was very considerate of my time and I came away with a professional new website with none of the hassle.. Every prospect that hasn’t converted is held up by some objection. The right testimonial will provide the social proof needed to convert the prospect. Sure Jane could place the above testimonials on the home page. Or in a rotating area in the sidebar header or footer. But there is a better way. Great marketers and sales people seem to know just the right time to say something. They can anticipate the next question in the mind of the prospect. The difficulty in writing good sales copy is anticipating the prospect’s next question without being with them physically. Put some thought into the placement of your testimonials. If you do you’llÂ likely find a strategic area to place each testimonial. For instance on the sales page for Jane’s website design services there will be should be an area where Jane addresses the issue of price. Some testing would be in order but for those without the time or the volume of traffic needed to test it would make sense to place this testimonial next to your discussion about pricing. In general don’t just place testimonials without thinking. Take a minute to place the testimonial in aÂ location where it has the best chance of overcoming the objection that is on the prospect’s mind. Unfortunately we have grown skeptical of testimonials. Too many scammers out there writing testimonials that range from clearly fake to slightly cheesy. As a result testimonials have to have meat on their bones. Consider adding the following to your testimonials to boost their credibility. Of course I’m kidding about the blood type but the point is that testimonials that provide more detail will convert better. They’reÂ simply more believable. For instance the testimonial written for Jane’s website design services will be much more credible if it looked like this. website design process was so simple. She was very considerate of my time and I came away with a professional new website with none of the hassle. Henneberry Director of Marketing Acme Manufacturing http://www.acmemanufacturing.com O Donor. First don’t be afraid to ask for testimonials. A happy customer is usually willing to provide a testimonial for you. After all you solved their problem. Be ready to pop the question at any point throughout your relationship with a customer. The best time to ask is when they praise you. Customers will often say things like. Jane!Â You really saved my life here. I really appreciate you being so responsive on this problem. My boss was breathing down my neck.. A logical follow-up from Jane would be. was my pleasure. I have really enjoyed working on this project. Would you mind providing me a short testimonial for my marketing materials?. How can they say no to that. Some customers don’t go out of their way to compliment you but if you know they’reÂ happy with your services ask for the testimonial. And when you ask the way you phrase the question is critical. Remember you’reÂ trying to address objections that prospects have while they’reÂ reading the sales copy on your website. For example if Jane knows she needs a testimonial that will overcome the price objection on her website she could phrase the request for testimonial this way. was my pleasure. I have really enjoyed working on this project. Would you mind providing me a short testimonial for my marketing materials Perhaps you could answer this question do you think working with Jane on your website redesign was a good value for your business?’. By phrasing the request for testimonial in this way you make it very likely that the customer will provide you with the testimonial you need to overcome the price objection. Take advantage of these tips and provide the powerful social proof needed to increases conversions. It’s true.Â All testimonials are not created equally.

Copy soÂ irresistibleÂ that readers rush hot and heavy through your sales letter...begging to do whatever it is you want them to do. Buy donate or subscribe. It doesn’t matter. They want to do it. But not everyone can write sales letters like that. Unless you know the three appeals that are behind every successful advertisement. The good sales letters use at least one of these appeals. The best use all three. What are these three appeals Let’s explore. Soft core. Hard core. No core. Sex sells. Men’s Health knows this and makes a mint from creating products and sales letter that put the physical act–and how to get better at/more of it–as a key motivator for sales. The image above is from one of their products–The Big Book of Sex. They do an excellent job of segmenting their audience between men and women...and then creating appeals that well...appeal to each. But using sex as an appeal isn’t limited to the physical act. Sex includes love friendship and affection. This is what I mean by core.. Love Panky is appealing to women who not only want to fall in true love with a man...but make that same man fall in love with them. What makes these appeals work so well is that they are native to what is being sold. Bad uses of this appeal occur when you try to pump up sales with woman who strip while you talk about your web domain service. Go Daddy anyone. It’s in our bones. That desire to live like the rich. Jet set around the world. Own boats as big as school buses. Spill more sashimi than most people will eat in a lifetime. The Rich Jerk successfully milked this appeal for years. And it’s what fuels the Motley Fool. Greed is why magazines like Money and Fortune are popular. While these magazines are straight-forward about their goal rich it’s less obvious in publications like Financial Times or Forbes. But it’s still there. If you can show someone how to make six figures a year retire young or evenÂ horde hundreds of products through coupons...then you are using the greed appeal correctly. Just like sex sells so does fear. It could be a test crash dummy hitting a dash board at 60 miles per hour. A group of teenagers piling up body bags outside of the headquarters of a cigarette manufacturer. Or a life of poverty for your children after you die. Fear appeals work on that sense of uncertainty we have. This is why insurance and services like tax shelters that protect your money from the hands of the government and greedy lawyers are so effective. For example look at the headline below from Stansberry Research. At first blush it might not seem to be about fear but notice the phrase your life. There’s the uncertainty I was talking about. It’s combined with the bad news of the U.S. debt downgrade to make an intriguing headline that could prove crucial if you decide to ignore. Using just one of these appeals in your sales letter will get you some good response. Use two and you’ll get even better. All three...that’s a sales letter orgasm. The headline Loud Sex Is a Billion Dollar Problem from Forbes combines fear and greed and sex effectively. You’ve got the sex greed Dollar\" and the fear This wouldn’t make a great sales letter headline however. You know why It’s not clear that the problem impacts the reader or that he’ll personally benefit if he reads the copy. If you want to do that you’d write the Loud Sex Problem Is Costing You a Billion Dollars.. Greed is behind the Publishing Clearing House’s Sweepstakes and state lottery games. Illinois took it a step further and hilariously wove fear into their greed appeal. Let me close with a little secret out of all of the above appeals greed is the most powerful. Meaning if you can appeal to people’s greed you are going to write a better sales letter. This is born out by my own experience...and it’s born out by copywritingÂ veteransÂ like John Caples. Then again if you can write a sales letter appeal combining all three...you just might be able to retire young in a radioactive-safe bunker with Angelina Jolie. Or Brad Pitt. Your choice. By the way the title of this post is Sexiest Way to Make So Much Money It Scares You.. Got any idea what that is. My idea was simply to combine all three appeals together in a sales letter but I was wondering if anybody could come up with a real occupation or gimmick that combines all three. Matching ponies to the person who shares the best idea. Part of the Sales Letter Makeover Series. Other posts in the series. About the Author Demian Farnworth is a freelance writer who blogs atÂ The CopyBot. Follow him onÂ TwitterÂ orÂ Google. I thought this would be a one word article porn. That falls into the category. Pretty cool The real work I believe is connecting the sex greed and fear with one’s not so sexy business That’s pretty true for most of us right. Can we all agree that copywriting is one word. start letter DEAR POTENTIAL CUSTOMER:Have I got a deal for you which I know you will not want to pass up. That will peak the reader’s interest to read more. Once you catch their attention the sale content is up to you. Name Email Message.

For a lot of bloggers self hosting with Wordpress.org provides the most professional blogging platform available. If you started out using Blogger and now need a professional presence there’s a good chance that you’re ready to switch to Wordpress.org. But the point of this article isnâ€TMt to convince you to switch. If you’re trying to decide whether or not to switch there are better articles to read. But if you have decided to switch this post will walk you through step by step how to quickly and easily transfer from Blogger to Wordpress.org. The first step in transferring from Blogger to Wordpress.org is to sign up for hosting. If you havenâ€TMt picked out a hosting company yet Blue Host offers low prices that are competitive with other popular Wordpress hosts and theyâ€TMre also reliable. To top it off they provide excellent customer service and theyâ€TMre control panel is one of the easiest to use. You canâ€TMt go wrong by choosing Blue Host. Another good choice is Host Gator. They offer some of the best rates in the business and they’re known for their excellent customer service. Note If you havenâ€TMt already purchased a domain name Blue Host also offers a free domain name when you set up your account. After signing up for hosting the next step is to install Wordpress on your hosting account. To do so first log into your hosting control panel. Next find the Wordpress icon located underneath a heading such as Installationâ or The wording will be different for each hosting company and you can always start a live chat with customer support if you need help. Once you find the icon follow the steps to install Wordpress. Note If possible youâ€TMll want to install Wordpress as a temporary installment. This will allow you to set up the site on a temporary site so you arenâ€TMt making all of the changes live while your readers are watching. The next step is to import posts from Blogger to Wordpress. To do so log into your temporary wordpress installment by going to http://yourtemporarydomain.com/wp-admin. After logging in go to the left-hand sidebar and click on and then select Posts.â On the next page where you’ll be asked which type of posts youâ€TMd like to import choose the option titled You’ll next be asked if youâ€TMd like to install an for Blogger.â The answer is yes so click the red button to install the importer. Then click to activate and install the plugin. Youâ€TMll now click to authorize Wordpress to access your Blogger account and then follow the steps to import posts from Blogger to Wordpress. Now that the posts have been transferred youâ€TMll need to double check that all of the posts and comments transferred correctly. You can do this by comparing the number of posts and comments in Wordpress to the number of posts and comments in Blogger. You’ll have at least one extra post and one extra page in Wordpress due to the fact that Wordpress automatically generates a welcome post and sample page when itâ€TMs first installed. Youâ€TMll want to delete each of these posts and pages. Note Sometimes not all of the posts or comments transfer correctly. If this is the case there may or may or may not be an easy way to get all of the posts transferred. You can contact Blogger or troubleshoot by searching on Google if these posts are critical for your blog. In cases like this itâ€TMs often easier to not worry about the lost posts and move on. After making sure the content transferred correctly and is ready to go navigate to in the right-hand sidebar of the Wordpress dashboard and select themes.Then click Themes at the top of the page and follow the steps to install a new Wordpress theme. Youâ€TMll want to pick out a theme that you like and configure it to work the way you want it to. After picking the right theme for your site you can take some time to configure it to look the way you want it to by installing plugins and widgets and adding pages. You can even pay a designer for a custom theme if youâ€TMre so inclined. The next step is to change the permalink structure in Wordpress. The reason you have to do this is that Blogger does crazy things with their permalink structure. In order to minimize the number of broken links you’ll need to change the permalink structure in Wordpress to match the crazy setup in Blogger. To do this click on in the left-hand sidebar of the Wordpress dashboard and then click permalinks. Now click the radio button for structure. To the right of the button copy and paste this The permalink structure in Wordpress will now match the structure on the old Blogger site. This will cause most of the links to work properly and minimize the number of broken links. Note This will minimize the number of broken links but it won’t eliminate them entirely. This is due to the fact that Blogger removes articles such as and from urls for post titles and Wordpress does not. Because of this a post with a title such as Absolute Best Way to Start a Wordpress Blog\, will have a url that looks like in Blogger and in Wordpress. One way to fix this is to go through and manually change the broken urls in Wordpress. The other way is to not worry about it. If there’s a third and better way and you know what that is make sure to leave a comment at the end of this post. Now that you’re using Wordpress you’ll need to sign up for Feedburner in order to manage RSS feeds and subscriptions yourself. Start by going to Feedburner and signing up for an account. You’l then walk through the steps to set up your Feedburner account and burn a feed. If you need more instructions about how to do that you can find that outÂ here and here. Now that the new Wordpress site is set up and ready to go you’re ready to change the domain settings of your temporary site assumes that you set up the site on a temporary domain. To do this log into your hosting panel and find an icon labeled and click. Next click on and then click the database for your Wordpress installation. Now find and click. Line 1 will be for your site url. Click to edit this line and change it out the url from the temporary one to the permanent one. Now click again click to edit line 37 and again replace the temporary url with the new one. Note If this step becomes too difficult contact customer for your hosting account. There’s a good chance that they can walk you through it by chat or even make the change for you. The next and final step is to forward the nameservers for your domain name. To do this you’ll log into the dashboard where you purchased your domain. You’ll then click to manage the domain and then click to edit the nameservers. You’ll do this by replacing them with the nameserver information where your site is hosted. The new nameservers will look something like this ns1.bluehost.com and ns2.bluehost.com. And that’s it for transferring a site from Blogger to Wordpress.org. By following these steps your new site will be ready to go.

What’s Your Type The 5-Step Guide to Finding the Right Font. 4 Unique Ways to Increase Email Marketing Conversion Rates. The name Amazon.com has become synonymous with eCommerce. If you are reading this blog there is no doubt that you have ordered something from Amazon.com from the comforts of your desktop or laptop computer. Today it is only slightly less likely that you have ordered something from Amazon from your phone. I’m no exception.Â Yesterday I ordered a pair of ear buds on my iPhone from Amazon in between the time my dental hygienist cleaned my teeth and the dentist came in to give me the verdict. We asked our Crazy Egg Design and Marketing Experts to analyze the Amazon mobile website design.Â Take a hard look yourself read through our opinions and if you are so inclined give us your analysis in the comments below. Design aspects that Amazon’s Mobile Homepage is doing well include. 1. Using a simple one column structure as a list view for the interface.Â Adding multi column structures for any small mobile device makes the entire real estate feel crammed and harder to use. 2. Keeping things simple by introducing high level functions and options that are most important such as search cart wish list streamlined menus. 3. Information for the product is minimal to start but if user is interested they can go to the next layout with more details.Â Biggest mistake most people make is providing too much copy/content on one screen especially for mobile. 4. Option to use full site at the bottom.Â Providing the user the option to choose experience is important. 5. Graphics colors and overall aesthetics are clean and minimal which help performance and keep maintenance costs lower. Keller Simple Flame. The user experience for the Amazon Mobile site should be very simple make it as easy as possible for someone to find a product and complete a purchase. This successfully achieves that and by focusing on the most popular product categories Kindle Movies and Electronics it can keep the navigation as intuitive as possible. I’m also really happy to see that they offer a clear link to the Amazon.com full site. It’s amazing how many mobile sites don’t do this. Robin Cannon Shiny Toy Robots. The Amazon mobile home page is a great example of a mobile optimized website. It’s easy to navigate and gives the user what they are looking for right away the amazon search bar. The ad below the search bar for Amazon Apps doesn’t appear to be an ad at all and is very likely the reason the user navigated to Amazon on their mobile device in the first place. The mobile site seems easy to navigate since appears very similar to the regular website. The cart is at the top always reminding you how many items you have so far and the search bar and department categories are easy to navigate as well. Angela Jones Design By Ange.la. Amazon are usability experts. Their website isn’t the prettiest thing out there nor is their mobile site but they do an amazing job of getting users to the products they want I buy just about everything I own from Amazon and I do that not only because of pricing but because it can be easier to find it on Amazon than my local retail outlet. Retailers are you listening. Given how much attention Amazon pays to what users are doing on their site they most likely took their top categories and made them easily accessible. The arrows on the buttons are great functional suggestions. I can tell that if I push Books the page is going to slide down in an accordion effect and I can tell that if I push See All Departments I’m going to head off to another screen. This is very effective in letting the user know what’s going to happen. To the savvy user it lets you know what you can do with a spotty 3G/4G connection and what you may want to wait for a more stable connection to do. I love how the account specific and sub-categories are styled differently. This style change lets me know that these choices are specific to me and/or my account. Finally the best part of all FULL SITE I can’t tell you how many poor mobile sites I’ve been to where the experience was so lacking I wanted to go to the full site. You know what those poor mobile sites all have in common They don’t let you go to the full site A to Amazon for giving me the freedom to choose. Christopher Lee Christoper Lee Designs. The site looks very clean and easy to use. The theme matches the www.amazon.com theme and helps promote the website’s branding. The two containers and yellow have different styles. The blue one has rounded corners and is smaller in width than the yellow one which has square corners. It might be more consistent if they were both the same style unless they are supposed to be separated. From the screenshot it is unclear as to whether the department list is used when a search is done is the case on the www.amazon.com. This is mainly due to having advertisement in between the search field and the department list. The Cart and Wishlist links are duplicated once up the top and once down the bottom. Given that mobile screen space is limited one set should be removed. Sanj Sahayam Unique Imprints. This is a very useful mobile page. It has most of the features of the main site in a smaller format with quick links to get to the most popular items. I would guess that Amazon has research or analytics telling them which categories are essential to show on this page so I trust their judgment. I could nitpick some stuff wasting so much height on the ad for the Kindle Fire ensuring that anyone on an iPhone will never see the menus without scrolling down first) but I said I wouldn’t nitpick so I’ll stop. Brian Schwartz Spoke Marketing. The great thing about the Amazon Mobile home page design is the fact that it is a simple design that one can identify as Amazon just by the fonts and colors.Â The use of the viewable space you would have to scroll below the fold is great. The subtle placement of below the logo is pretty sly plus having the button to promote the mobile app below the search bar is a great idea. The end user may find it easier to download the app and have it readily available then have to navigate to Amazon each time through the phone’s browser. Joseph Kalinowski Content Marketing Institute. The Amazon mobile home page does an impressive job of presenting their large and complex navigation into a scaled down intuitive menu. The order and use of different colors for the primary and secondary menus helps provide visual clarity. I like that they’ve featured search and their mobile app at the top of the page since those are likely top actions for mobile users. The blue primary accent color leaves orange on the color wheel as the optimal CTA color which they implemented fairly well. On the improvement note links on the page need an audit check for adequate text size and padding to ensure they’re easily clickable. Your pinky nail can work as a handy mobile sizing/spacing guide for links since it’s mostly likely the size of the your index finger’s pressable surface area.. Angie Schottmuller Search Engine Watch. This is a very decent way to show the most popular navigation options. I’m sure that Amazon tested this pretty thoroughly before concluding what people would click on most. The only thing I’d like if I were to use that application is that the advertisement was further down underneath the departments. It seems more intuitive to have them directly underneath the search box instead. Naomi Niles ShiftFWD. I think the Amazon homepage has struck an excellent balance between easy navigation to a lot of different places is absolutely necessary given the complexity of the site) and showcasing the product that they are currently trying to the Kindle Fire. The guideline that I’d take away from this design is that first you want to put front and center in front of your audience whatever you want them to see and then immediately give them access to anything that they might be looking for. Danny Iny Firepole Marketing. First I think it is clear that getting the word out about Kindle Fire is a primary goal of Amazon’s.Â I like the way the product is featured with an image and a clear call-to-action without trying to say too much on the mobile home page.Â If you want to know more click the More link. Secondly it is clear that it has been detected that I am using an iPhone to reach the mobile version of the website.Â This has caused the mobile home page to display a call-to-action to download their iPhone applications. Lastly the navigation is brilliantly organized which is no small feat for a company that sells the wide array of products that Amazon sells.Â They list the most popular on the home page and then a link to All Departments if you don’t find what you are looking for.Â This allows them to serve the majority of people without cluttering up the mobile interface with links. Russ Henneberry Tiny Mighty Media. We know that many of our readers are experts in design and marketing as well. We would love to hear your critique of the Amazon Mobile Home Page in the comments. I think the navigation is great. And the color scheme is transcendent of their desktop version. Amazon’s branding is their usability.. digitally at least. They are missing a huge oppertunity to harness that same gut feeling through their TV and print media. Name Email Message.

Engaging voters online is an increasingly important part of the electoral process. The 2008 Presidential campaign saw Barack Obama and the Democratic Party rightly complimented for their effective use of web technology and social media. As the Republican presidential primary campaign continues has the GOP learned some of those lessons How are the four remaining candidates portraying themselves online. Romney makes a big mistake immediately by hiding his main website behind a very mundane splash page. The splash page is intended to encourage people to sign up for updates about the campaign and the need for any candidate to develop a strong list is important. But this call to action could easily have been incorporated into the main site right now the first experience anyone has visiting Romney’s campaign site is a mediocre and unattractive extra-step. I’m sure it’s going to put off a lot of visitors. Once you get past the splash page Romney has a pretty appealing site. The layout is strong and makes really effective use of imagery. Good use of white space gives a clean and professional look. It’s easy to find more about Romney and his stance on the issues as well as latest campaign news. It’s also the only site that provides really visible links to state specific information for all 50 states. I like the very clear calls to action for the main social media services. Facebook Twitter and Google options to share major stories are seamlessly integrated and there are separate options for engaging with the candidate directly on social media. This suggests a clear understanding that there’s a distinction between building social media followers and sharing content. GRADE B. Gingrich’s site scores highly for usability but doesn’t have a really strong visual impact. It’s well put together but very traditional in its layout and appearance. Kind of like a very standard blog template and that means it looks dated. Navigation is simple and there are very clear calls to action for anyone interested in getting involved with the campaign donating or buying campaign related merchandise. Social media seems very much an afterthought given that Gingrich has a massive Twitter following compared to any of the other candidates. It also looks like some areas of the site aren’t updated often enough. As I write this there are still sections on helping Gingrich win in the Iowa caucus or New Hampshire primary both events that happened a couple of weeks ago. GRADE C. Ron Paul’s the only candidate using WordPress for his campaign website the other candidates use Drupal. Initial engagement is strong. I really like his donation thermometer with a real time count and the donor helps to suggest that the Paul campaign engages with individual people. It makes for a powerful call to action for donations. I was confused navigating around the site. The two columns of articles on the front page is an opinion-based Ticker’ the other is Paul in the News’ aren’t very well differentiated. The navigation bar has too many options and the different sections of the site could be more clearly defined. Social media integration is relatively low key and the site is generally more than the others indeed Paul is as a candidate. I think it would benefit from a larger font size it’s fallen into the pixel trap that might look OK at first glance but isn’t that well suited to easily browsing text. GRADE B. I just don’t like this website. The layout is odd and looks very strange in larger windows it’s like they’ve tried to create a fluid width layout without really understanding the principle. It’s blocky a little ugly and has bad typography. Add in a lack of any clear call to action and I’m unsure what the site is trying to achieve. Even the language is a little unusual with some sections written in the third person and some sections written in the first person. It gives the feeling of a by committee website that doesn’t have any strong creative vision or sense of purpose. Of all the primary candidate websites Santorum’s is the one that looks the most amateurish. The first time it took me a few moments to work out where the navigation was the site layout works in such a way as to completely draw the eye away from that menu. GRADE D. It’s clear that the leading GOP candidates have upped their game and understand the importance of a good website candidates John Huntsman Rick Perry Herman Cain and Michelle Bachmann also have reasonably polished sites. There’s still a lot of room to improve. None of the sites use any HTML 5 technology their SEO is basic and none of the design is particularly outstanding. The GOP candidates may have taken some steps to improve their online presence but they have a long way to go. About the Author. Robin Cannon is Web Engineer at Function(x Inc.

If you are a Twitter hashtag veteran bear with me for a moment.Â We will get to some advanced stuff shortly. For those that are new to Twitter hashtags let’s start with the basics. Hashtags are a way of organizing Twitter.Â Twitter users are able to sort tweets that contain a particular hashtag.Â By viewing tweets that contain a hashtag we are able to have conversations about topics on Twitter. For example any tweet with the hashtag added to it can be easily found using Twitter.com or 3rd party tools like Hootsuite and Tweetdeck. Adding a hashtag to a tweet allows it to go beyond your own network to as many people that are following that hashtag to see real time conversation about that topic. You can see a hashtag in action by simply tweeting this post I used the hashtag in the title so everyone who tweets it will get to use one right off the bat. Hashtags can be used in a variety of ways for different purposes. Some useful ways to use them include the following. Gain a Wider Audience for Your Message. Add a hashtag to your tweets relevant to get a wider audience for your update. This way instead of just your followers seeing your latest tweet on web design you can add to your tweet to get anyone who is following that hashtag to see it as well. Capitalize on Trending Topics. Be on the lookout for trending topic hashtags and add them to your tweets when applicable. Use the Trending topics on your Twitter homepage to see the latest. If you are looking to target a local marketing click on the change link to see trends within a specific location. If you’re not sure what a particular trend is about you can click on it to see the latest tweets or go to What the Trend to see other user’s explanations of why something is popular. Monitor Industry News. Want to follow hashtags in your industry You can do it a few different ways. You could search for the hashtag on Twitter and use the Save this search button to save it on your Twitter account. But a better way to do it would be to use a Twitter management tool like HootSuite above) Tweetdeck or similar. These programs allow you to add a column to your dashboard with the hashtag and will automatically update the stream as new tweets come in. In HootSuite you would click the Add Stream button then add as your search query under the Search tab. In Tweetdeck you would click the Add Column button select Search as the column type and enter in the search box. This is a great way to see the latest tweets on industry-related hashtags. You’ll probably see everything from random quotes popular articles and even job listings. Answer Questions on a Particular Topic. Take the above tip on following industry hashtags one step further by following questions asked on a particular hashtag by using the search query -filter:links. Setting this search up on Twitter HootSuite Tweetdeck or similar applications will allow you to see questions asked about a particular topic without any links in the tweet. Answer these questions to help build your authority in the web design industry. Create Valuable Resources. You can use sites like Paper.li which will allow you to create around hashtags. You can see this web design daily as an example. Find the Top Products. As a web designer you might be asked your opinion on using particular things such as blog platforms. Use Topsy Analytics and enter the platforms mentioned by your client as hashtags to see the number of people talking about them. The one talked about the most is probably the best choice for your client and you as the designer since there will be more community support. The following are a sampling of various design related hashtags that you can add to your own tweets or monitor within the web design industry. Also don’t forget about Twitter chats Twitter chats are formed when groups of people meet at a certain time on Twitter to discuss a certain topic and use a specific hashtag like This Twitter chat for creative professionals happens on Wednesday at 8PM CST for one hour. Use the TweetChat site to monitor and engage with this Twitter chat. Find more Twitter chats and hashtags on the Twitter Chat Schedule spreadsheet on Google Docs. If you’re debating about using different variations of a hashtag like or then enter all three on the earlier mentioned Topsy Analytics tool. It will show you a graph of how many times each hashtag has been mentioned in the last day week two weeks or month. Then Scroll down for a sampling of tweets with that hashtag plus some useful data about them. The number under All shows the number of times that particular link has been tweeted. The number under Influential shows the likelihood that an influential user on Twitter will notice your update using that hashtag. Seeing how each tag is used and the popularity of tweets within the tag should help you make the best decision on what to use with your tweet. Hashtags are no longer only for Twitter. They are starting to gain popularity on Google as well. Check out posts on Google tagged with and start thinking about how you can incorporate hashtags to expand your Google audience as well. To monitor industry discussion on Google+ search for a hashtag and then use the Save this search button. Then follow the discussion anytime using the links in the left sidebar of your Google account. Getting on Google hashtags could be a great way to get new followers just be sure that your updates are Public so everyone can see them. How do you use Twitter hashtags What other ones would you suggest for web designers to use or follow Please share them in the comments. About the Author Kristi Hines is a freelance writer blogger and social media enthusiast. Her blog Kikolani focuses on blog marketing including social networking strategies and blogging tips. Cool overview. Definitely find there are a lot of people out there who have a vague conception about what hashtags are but don’t really know how to use them effectively. You can find some great tweets leading to great resources by permanently or semi-permanently following certain hashtags I tend to find that I end up with too many Tweetdeck columns if I try and follow everything I want!. If you’re aiming at an external audience be careful of the hashtags you’re using. Most particularly be aware of some of the acronyms that might be confusing. Something like or are easily recognizable to people within a certain industry but perhaps you’re trying to provide some resources to explain or introduce these topics if that’s the cause then the audience might not be well targeted by the use of acronyms. Question on the paper.li I often get tagged as having contributed to these but I can’t remember ever really getting any return traffic to my website or Twitter follows that are identifiably from that source. Are there any statistics on whether paper.li sites have any real audience on an individual basis It’s an interesting aggregator service but certainly I tend to trust personally curated sites far more. Hi Robin. Good point on the acronym hashtags. Do you use Google Analytics I see paper.li and their competitors scoop.it summify.com in my Traffic Sources Referral Traffic section. With paper.li you can click on the link in your Referral Traffic to see which users papers have sent the most traffic and with the other two you can see which posts on your site got the most traffic from them. Thanks for putting this together. Thanks for the great blog post Most definitely going to share it with my connections. Pingback 15 Twitter Hashtags for How To Use Them Template Y Plugin WordPress.

clueweb12-0000tw-00-00093,Live thread - Eric Holder's testimony before House Oversight and Government Reform Committee The Obama File.,,Live thread - Eric Holder's testimony before House Oversight and Government Reform Committee The Obama File. Starting at 9:00am this morning the Committee on Oversight Government Reform is carrying a live feed of of Eric Holder's testimony in front of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee. Mathew Staver says due to previous inconsistent testimony that was riddled with misdirection and cover-up Attorney General Eric Holder is being forced into a showdown with Rep. Darrell Issa and the committee today. Labeled a witness by Chairman Issa Holder and the Department of Justice must now satisfactorily explain their roles and subsequent actions in the now infamous and Furious debacle that resulted in the murder of a U.S. Border Agent and a yet to be determined loss of life in Mexico. Chairman Issa recently declared that the Department of Justice blood on their hands. Liberty Counsel Action has launched a powerful Fax Barrage telling Chairman Issa and his committee that Americans are OUTRAGED over Holderâ€TMs deplorable performance as Attorney General. Sadly and Furious is just one instance of gross mismanagement that justifies our call for Eric Holderâ€TMs forced resignation firing or impeachment. Fortress Holder - A year of Justice deprtment stonewalling. Letter to Holder - Comply with Fast Furious subpoena or face contempt charges. Originally posted by ballpoint. Unlike Georgia this is a beautiful feed. I have to go out this AM. Will update later. Hope some of you are watching and will comment. There are live comments at the link above. AG Holder's testimony in a nutshell. Groundhog Day Holder repeats Fast and Furious lies. IBD EDitorials says it's a scandal. In a shameful performance the attorney general Thursday reprised his tap-dancing routine before a panel investigating the Fast and Furious gunrunning operation that got U.S. agents and Mexicans killed. Groundhog Day and Brian Terry's family and taxpayers are still waiting for Fast and Furious answers from the Justice Department\, Chairman Darrell Issa said before the hearings. will not wait until the next Groundhog Day to get answers for the American people. Rep. Issa R-Calif. has threatened Attorney General Eric Holder with a contempt of Congress citation if he doesn't get answers to questions on Fast and Furious such as who authorized it and what and when Holder knew. The story constantly changes. After Thursday's deja vu hearing in front of Issa's House Government Oversight Committee we're still waiting. The attorney general keeps insisting he didn't authorize it that he's still not sure when he became aware of it and no no one has been held responsible for providing weapons to Mexican drug cartels. is no attempt at any kind of cover-up\, Holder said under questioning. have shared huge amounts of information and continue to do so. Rep. Dan Burton R-Ind. noted that the Justice Department has released only 6\,400 pages of the 93\,000 pages of documents related to Fast and Furious with the rest being held under some arcane and specious separation of powers argument. Thursday's hearings came almost a year to the day that Holder and the Justice Department sent a letter to Congress lying about what it knew and what it did about Fast and Furious. Holder was appearing for the third time to continue to weave his tangled web of deceit and falsehoods. As in the movie Day\, it is a fable we are constantly forced to relive. On Feb. 4 2011 Assistant Attorney General Ron Welch in response to the investigations by Issa and Sen. Chuck Grassley R-Iowa of the gun program run out of ATF's Phoenix office wrote a letter stating that the that ATF or otherwise knowingly allowed the sale of assault weapons .. is false. After a series of Friday document dumps exposed DOJ's deceit Deputy Attorney General James Cole in another letter to Congress wrote have come to light during the course of this investigation that indicate the Feb. 4 letter contains inaccuracies. In other words the Justice Department lied to Congress. It lied again Thursday in the person of the attorney general who once again failed to provide the whole truth and nothing but the truth. Eric Holder and his department have lied to Congress. Scooter Libby was sentenced to prison for much less. We await Holder's fate and hope justice will prevail. Gowdy repeats call for Holder to resign easy way\, or be impeached hard way. Matthew Boyle is reporting that South Carolina Republican Rep. Trey Gowdy reaffirmed his call for Attorney General Eric Holderâ€TMs resignation easy way\, or impeachment hard way\, during an interview with The Daily Caller after Thursdayâ€TMs House oversight committee hearing during which Holder testified about Operation Fast and Furious. While he was questioning Holder at the hearing Gowdy explained that officials at the Department of Justiceâ€TMs headquarters were aware of Fast and Furious and gun-walking tactics long before a false letter was sent to Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley claiming otherwise. Since the DOJ sent that letter which stated it never let guns walk it has withdrawn the letter because it of its inaccuracies. think he wound up admitting at the end the hearing that Main Justice knew of gun-walking so this notion that weâ€TMre going to blame it all on the United States Attorneyâ€TMs office in Arizona or ATF - I went through a litany of people all of them were Main Justice employees who knew about gunwalking both in Fast and Furious and before which means the letter that was sent to Senator Grassley was demonstrably false\, Gowdy told TheDC. still havenâ€TMt gotten any of his emails\, noted Gowdy donâ€TMt have any documents after February 4 so itâ€TMs clear to me that people at Main Justice knew that gun-walking was going on in Fast and Furious. Itâ€TMs also clear to me that absolutely nothing has happened to a single solitary person as a result of this other than one dead Border Patrol agent and lots of Mexican citizens. Beyond that I canâ€TMt find a single consequence that has befallen anybody who knew about this.. Regardless of the mounting evidence that high-ranking officials were aware of and approved gun-walking - which includes what Gowdy laid out and newly public emails between former acting ATF director Ken Melson and Assistant Attorney General Lanny Breuer the head of the DOJâ€TMs Criminal Division in which Breuer describes what appears to be Fast and Furious gun-walking tactics as a idea in 2009 - House oversight committee Democrats claim that high-ranking DOJ officials never knew about or approved gun-walking. Gowdy described a lengthy report that the committeeâ€TMs ranking member Democratic Rep. Elijah Cummings released earlier this week as false.. theyâ€TMre wrong\, he said. one email proves it. The phrase Receiver is never used in that email itâ€TMs Trusty and Weinstein theyâ€TMre talking about Fast and Furious they mention gun-walking they talk about the press consequences of it nobody ever gets around to talking about the moral implications of it they just more worried about the press.. Gowdy added that if had more time with Holder during the hearing he would have proven how gun laws already on the books - if Holderâ€TMs DOJ and ATF actually enforced them rather than not following them themselves - would have been more than enough to keep them from needing to arm the Mexican drug cartels to make a case for new gun laws. Democrats on the committee and Holder argued that new gun laws would have kept ATF agents who werenâ€TMt enforcing the gun laws already on the books from letting guns walk. we had another round of questions I was going to prove to the Attorney General - which he already knows - that there are plenty of gun laws on the books right now that if used could have more than adequately prosecuted this case\, Gowdy said. the notion that the fix is just got to get Congress to pass more gun laws is just sheer sophistry. And I could have proven that but I only got what eight minutes?. Gowdy might get another chance soon. more hearings the merrier\, he told TheDC. some point the chairman is going to have to decide whether or not to force to the issue of making DOJ turn over documents post-February 4\, Gowdy said. one believes that theyâ€TMre doing it only to stand on principle. Thereâ€TMs something in those documents they do not want us to see. So yeah until we can answer those questions they and Holder can talk about politics all they want.. Gowdy a prosecutor before entering politics shrugs off the partisan criticism against Republicans seeking answers and accountability for Fast and Furious victims. actually worked for the Justice Department that was headed by Janet Reno Clintonâ€TMs Attorney General]\, he said. yeah the good thing about prosecutors and law enforcement is thereâ€TMs no Republican or Democrat. Itâ€TMs just the facts. And you shouldnâ€TMt be afraid to disclose them. But for whatever reason theyâ€TMre not going to turn over those documents and weâ€TMll stay on it until they do.. not about Eric Holder to me as much as it is the reputation and the integrity of the top law enforcement official in this country and the Department of Justice\, Gowdy added. not about politics. If it were about politics Iâ€TMd say give us Jason Weinstein Trusty Breuer. Itâ€TMs about being able to look my constituents in the eyes and say you can have trust in the Department of Justice because right now the way it looks to me is that they are engaged in this deflecting the blame going to make you prove it\, not going to give you documents unless thereâ€TMs a court order. Thatâ€TMs just unacceptable to me. Obama can stop Holder's Fast and Furious cover-up today. The Washington Examiner says it appears that Attorney General Eric Holder didn't read the executive order President Obama issued on his first day in the White House. Obama pledged that his administration would provide the American people with unprecedented level of openness in government. Either he didn't read it or Holder thinks the executive order doesn't cover Operation Fast and Furious the misguided Justice Department program that allowed thousands of weapons to be sold in the United States to known gunrunners for Mexican drug cartels. The idea was the government would then track the guns thus enabling prosecution of cartel figures by linking them to particular weapons found at crime scenes. But officials lost track of an estimated 1\,400 such guns two of which turned up at the scene of U.S. Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry's slaying in Arizona in December 2010. Terry's slaying sparked a national uproar and prompted an investigation by the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee chaired by Rep. Darrell Issa. The committee described the response of Holder's department to that investigation in a report released last Thursday months the department has stonewalled committee document requests and refused to comply with committee subpoenas. The department has produced scores of blacked-out pages containing no information and many duplicate documents in order to bolster its page count. Recently the Department's Inspector General office disclosed that it has reviewed approximately 80\,000 pages of documents related to Fast and Furious and conducted approximately 70 interviews in its investigation. That investigation is not even close to completion. comparison the department has produced just over 6\,000 pages to Congress representing only 8 of the materials available to the IG. The department is withholding 92 of the documents it has given the IG. Also Congress has conducted 22 interviews - only 31 of the total the IG has already conducted. If the department granted Congress access to all the documents and witnesses available to the IG it would be much closer to determining who was actually responsible for Fast and Furious. The committee's use of the word is significant. The word became famous when President Nixon and his senior aides used it in discussing their response to inquiries about the Watergate break-in of 1972. It led in turn to the now-familiar maxim that the cover-up is always worse than the original crime. Holder and his fellow Obama political appointees at the Justice Department aren't kidding anybody within or outside Congress They are furiously stonewalling the Issa panel's investigation even as they hide behind an obviously empty claim that they are defending the separation of powers between Congress and the executive branch. When only 8 percent of the requested documents are produced and witnesses either refuse to testify while citing their Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination or are barred from testifying by their executive branch superiors it becomes obvious that the political appointees are covering up actions that are either criminal in nature or that they fear would be politically damaging to Obama. If Obama meant what he wrote in his first executive order the cover-up by his Justice Department appointees could stop as soon as he orders it. If he doesn't he endorses the cover-up. An oldie but goodie Gunrunner/Fast and Furious was one of the first things that Obama and Holder did when they assumed power. Posted before but needs to be revisited. The simple fact is Barack Obama was the architect of Fast Furious. Holder was the contractor. On March 24 2009 just sixty days after the inauguration Deputy Attorney General David Ogden announced from the White House that president has directed us to take action... and Attorney General Holder and I have taken several new and aggressive steps.... In government terms that's that's a Priority I project. That's a fast-track project. Ogden goes on to describe those steps saying to its Project Gunrunner.. specifically to facilitate gun tracing....

Something occurred to me recently. Times have really changed. We no longer live in a world where Ricky Martin is having to swear he isnâ€TMt gay. Instead heâ€TMs having to swear that he isnâ€TMt gay married. I never thought Iâ€TMd see the day. But here we are with 6 states Iowa New York New Hampshire Vermont and Connecticut and the District of Columbia proudly offering marriage licenses to all couples gay and straight alike while another 2 states and Washington have opened the 2012 season jockeying to see which can claim to be the eighth jurisdiction to legalize gay marriage. Further there are several other states including Illinois Hawaii Delaware Rhode Island and New Jersey offering civil unions and other broad partnership recognition rights to same sex couples. You can learn more about the map of marriage equality here. This means that Wedding Pros in these areas should be making some conscious decisions about their marketing materials and the audience to whom they wish to speak if they havenâ€TMt already done so. More than ever gay and lesbian couples are out there and the audience is listening. 2012 WeddingWire Inc Home Contact Us.

By Silcox 9 2012 11:57 pm Just over four years ago in a supermarket far far away Harvard basketball coach Tommy Amaker bumped into Zack Rosenâ€TMs dad shopping while a high school basketball tournament was going on in Trenton N.J. It was chronicled in an investigative piece by the New York Times on some potentially dirty recruiting by the Harvard basketball program. really should get Zack up to Harvard\,â Amaker reportedly said to Rosenâ€TMs father about recruiting the high school stud. Or as I like to imagine it went a little something like this. Darth Vader Luke you do not yet realize your importance. You have only begun to discover your power. Join me and I will complete your training. With our combined strength we can end this destructive conflict and bring order to the galaxy. Luke Iâ€TMll never join you. Darth Vader If you only knew the power of the Dark Side. If only Zack had known the power. Had he joined the Dark Side he could have won his first Ivy League title last year. He could be well on his way to the NCAA tournament this season. He could be on a nationally ranked team. No regrets right. Harvard is the antagonist to the Ivy saga this year a growing danger challenging the Ivy power structure of Penn and Princeton. In a short period of time Harvard has become the Yankees the Cowboys the Heat of the Ivy League the team everyone loves to hate. Why. Many complain about Harvardâ€TMs rise. Perhaps it was predicated on some less-than-proper recruiting. Maybe Amaker has ruffled a few feathers along the way. Who cares. The Crimson are the leagueâ€TMs target for no reason other than the fact that they win. The same is true of Penn football which the rest of the league despises simply because of the Quakersâ€TM dominance over the last two decades. Honestly itâ€TMs more fun this way. Penn fans complain about the recent drought of Ivy titles but isnâ€TMt a little more league parity fun Thereâ€TMs a new favorite and a new challenger each year. Every league needs a villain. Even more a villain is exactly what Penn basketball needs.

Freshman Kara Bonenbergerâ€TMs play in the post will be vital in establishing an offensive rhythm and helping break Pennâ€TMs slump. Even with Valentineâ€TMs Day fast approaching the Penn womenâ€TMs basketball team was unable to catch a break as they will return to a land of heartbreak this weekend. The Quakers 1-4 Ivy will travel to Harvard 4-1)on Friday a place where third-year coach Mike McLaughlin has watched the Crimson pull out down-to-the-wire games in his two previous trips. In McLaughlinâ€TMs first season a 1-24 Penn team fell 55-52 on a three with 1.3 seconds left. Last season the Crimson survived two overtime periods and 38 points from Alyssa Baron to win 88-84. If the Quakers want to avoid repeating history they will have to bring it offensively. us to shoot a higher percentage the ball is going to have to get inside\,â McLaughlin said pointing to freshman forward Kara Bonenberger as the only player shooting above 40 percent. Penn is currently second to last in field-goal percentage and last in three-point shooting percentage in the Ivy League. Despite their lack of success from beyond the arc the Quakers attempted 33 threes against Brown in their most recent game which they lost in overtime. not a team that shoots at a high rate anyway\,â McLaughlin said. when we end up taking 33 of them thatâ€TMs never going to work for us.â He believes the team has often settled for perimeter looks against attacking zone defenses that prevent them from establishing an inside presence. definitely need to get the ball in the post\,â Baron said. will open up things from the outside too so that weâ€TMre not shooting as many threes or threes from as deep. I think we just need to focus more on looking at the post in the first place and throwing it in there making a good pass for them.â. Penn did receive encouraging performances from post players Katy Allen and Bonenberger last weekend. The pair averaged 11 and 8.5 points over the two games respectively. think Kara kind of struggled a bit for about five or six games maybe a little bit with her confidence but I thought she played two really good games weekend and I think thatâ€TMs only going to help her\,â McLaughlin said. a confidence kid. And if she feels good about what sheâ€TMs doing then I think the skyâ€TMs the limit.â. role has obviously increased since forward Jess got hurt and I think she has handled herself great\,â he added. Penn mired in a 1-9 slide after a program-best start will also face a similarly struggling Dartmouth squad Saturday. Something will have to give in a matchup between two teams that each have a lone Ivy win over Columbia. year we let that game slip away too\,â Baron said referring to a 68-65 road defeat to the Big Green. definitely looking to get in there and take advantage of them.â. McLaughlin feels that the teamâ€TMs attitude has not significantly changed through the season but acknowledged itâ€TMs tough after starting out winning seven of nine games and then losing nine of 10. It is important mentally for the Quakers not only to play well but also to find a way back into the win column according to McLaughlin. think confidence and morale is naturally boosted when you find a way to win.â.

Comments send a tip. about. contribute. subscribe. Amid the Republican-led furor over the Obama administration’s requirement that even religious-affiliated employers provide prescription birth control the nation’s largest Catholic university said this week it covers contraception as part of its health care benefit package. The 1\,800 employee-university covers contraception in both its fully-insured HMO plan and its self-insured PPO. DePaul responded to a complaint from the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission several years ago and added artificial contraception as a benefit to its Blue Cross PPO. DePaul University’s admission seems to contradict the Republican refrain that the contraception requirement which is part of the Affordable Care Act is an unprecedented attack on religious freedom. The rule exempts houses of worship and religious nonprofits but some Catholics say that protection is too narrow. While the Vatican for the most part opposes contraception 98 percent of sexually active Catholic women use birth control. The Affordable Care Act provision was modeled on contraceptive coverage requirements already on the books in 28 states including Illinois. Nonetheless Obama signaled he may pull out of that policy in the face of mounting GOP opposition. DePaul you may remember also scored dead last on a campus sexual health report card released by Trojan was 139 out of 141 last year too. Contraceptive availability factored into the rankings so we wonder exactly how the Blue Demons must have irked Trojan maybe they prefer Durex.

Comments send a tip. about. contribute. subscribe. Today's lead story in the Sun-Times is about the possibility that serial killer John Wayne Gacy may have had at least an accomplice in three of his murders. Criminal defense attorneys Robert Stephenson and Steven Becker re-examined the cases of Russell Nelson of Minneapolis and Robert Gilroy and John Mowery of Chicago. they were among the 29 of Gacy's 33 victims found under the crawlspace of his Norwood Park home in 1979. Becker and Stephenson reviewed Gacy's work and travel records which they say indicated he was out of town when Nelson and Gilroy disappeared. They also contend Gacy's work records didn't leave him enough time to abduct and kill Mowery. The evidence seems to strongly indicate Gacy had accomplices in the Gilroy and Nelson deaths. Stephenson said Gacy flew to Pittsburgh on Sept. 12 1977 and returned to Chicago on Sept. 16 1977. Robert Gilroy was reported missing Sept. 15 1977. Russell Nelson went missing Oct. 19 1977 while he and a friend were at a bar in Chicago. Nelson's mother said the friend later gave her a different account of his disappearance and revealed the friend offered two of Nelson's brothers jobs in Chicago with Gacy. Stephenson said he and Becker are ready and willing to share their findings with Cook County Sheriff Tom Dart including thee name of Nelson's friend. Dart's office has been working to identify the remains of Gacy's eight John Doe victims through DNA testing since last summer. Two presumed victims were found to be living alive and well in Florida and Oregon while the remains of one of the John Does was identified as William George Bundy. This isn't the first time that it's been presumed Gacy had accomplices. Gacy himself suggested that to CBS 2's Walter Jacobson a few years before he was executed in 1994. We've included video of Gacy's assertion to Jacobson below. all our citiesone convenient app.

AP Photo/Julio Cortez Bulls forward Luol Deng finally earned his first trip to the All-Star game yesterday when he was named as a reserve for the Eastern Conference team. Despite slightly lower stats than in past seasons and missing seven games due to an injured wrist Deng was selected by the league's coaches to play in the mid-season exhibition and will join Derrick Rose in Orlando when the league's top players take the court on Feb. 26. Averaging 16 points 7.3 rebounds and 2.5 assists Deng's scoring has been down this year yet he remains the team's second leading scorer and critical to the team's success. The Bulls hold an NBA-best 22-6 record but three of the Bulls six losses came during that seven game stretch that Deng sat out. Bulls head coach Tom Thibodeau said before Deng's selection was announced play speaks for itself. He plays great defense. He plays a great floor game. He moves without the ball. He makes the extra pass. You can't measure his impact statistically. I know what he brings. I know all the coaches and all his teammates appreciate everything that he does.. Fellow All-Star Rose also should be relieved that Deng will be joining him in Orlando. know that I'd probably be more hurt than Lu he doesn't make it]\, the league's MVP said Wednesday night. that he has a nonchalant attitude about making the team. But I think that he deserves it. We do too. During his eight year career he has performed at a level worthy of All-Star consideration. This year he finally got the recognition for his contribution to the Bulls success.

Ever since Paul McGee announced he was leaving The Whistler rumors have swirled about what exactly he was going to do next. We knew he was joining up with Lettuce Entertain You and we had heard something about a country bar with the Melman boys. Frankly a country bar matter how good the whiskey list didn't really get us cocktail nerds going so our attention waned. Imagine our newfound excitement when we heard that half of the project was going to be a brand new Tiki Bar. McGee has been a promoter of tiki-style cocktails for years and we've enjoyed his tiki nights at the Whistler. Tiki in Chicago aside from those brief moments at The Whistler has been in something of a deep freeze since Trader Vic's closed last year. Looks like the rum umbrellas fruit juices and palm fronds are coming back. Below the country-themed bar will be sophisticated 4\,000 square foot Tiki lounge where visitors can classic drinks featuring fresh-squeezed juices and other exotic ingredients. The tiki bar name yet will have it's own private entrance and supposedly will boast the city's most extensive rum collection. To assuage the fears of those accustomed to Melman properties like Sub 51 and Studio Paris this will not be a nightclub nor will the focus be on the scene. McGee told Time Out Chicago that the tiki bar will be serious about the quality of the drinks wouldn't expect anything less and R.J. Melman emphasized that unlike nightclubs bars are We couldn't be more excited about this. One of the best mixers in the city with a serious personal love for tiki drinks will be mixing up our Royal Hawaiians Mai Tais and whatever else he comes up with. Plus we don't have to feign enthusiasm about yet another pre-prohibition style cocktail bar with arm-banded mixologists. You can bet we'll be there on opening night. The new bar will be located at 435 N. Clark Street.

In a recent interview with the Dartmouth College blog Dartbeat\,Â Ty Segall said he will release two new albums within the next six months in addition to his upcoming collaboration with White Fence. Thanks toÂ Robert Szypko for the tip. Segall says the first LP will be mini LP for In the Red collecting eight songs written and recorded with his touring band. Of the record he said live band is so much different than me recording stuff on my own it's a lot harder and louder.. The other album will as usual be written and recorded by Segall on his own and will be released viaÂ Drag City. Of his previously reported collaboration with White Fence titled Hair and also forthcoming from Drag City Segall said doesn't really sound like either one of us. It's kinda like starting a new band. He added\,Â sounds a bit more drug influenced a bit more psychedelic and weird.. Watch Ty Segall's slightly NSFW video for Bread\".

Let's call this an album OK In any case Fucked Up have been releasing long songs for each year of the Chinese Zodiac since 2006 although they're running a little behind at the moment. Year of the Tiger ended in February 2011 we've passed through the Rabbit Year and are now in the Dragon Year.. Year of the Tiger is a pair of tracks that have been around for a while- the band claimed to have finished the title song almost two years ago. It's the first music we've heard from the band in a while that doesn't have some formal connection to their David Comes to Life project. of the Tiger itself is a 15-minute song with a very long lyric by guitarist Mike Haliechuk about an aging tiger approaching his death. Fucked Up's lead bellower Damian Abraham gets most of the words to himself although he's also got some support former Del-Byzanteens singer/keyboardist Jim Jarmusch- yes fine he's a director too- intones a few verses and either Annie-Claude DeschÃanes Duchess Says or Katie Stelmanis Austra or both add the pretty hey-I-can-actually-sing vocals that FU have been using for contrast with Abraham's voice over the past few years. The marvelous thing about of the Tiger is that it's actually a fully constructed song not a vamp-with-solos or a chain of vaguely related pieces segued together it builds and builds and builds with one new riff after another uncoiling itself and wrapping around the pillar of all the others. It's bombastic as hell of course- the keyboard part is the closest Fucked Up have ever come to Meat Loaf- but this is the product of a band that thinks big. The song's weak point is its lyrics which have lots of sharply observed images castle of gristle and bone\") but also too many passages with dodgy or overwrought diction deathly coddle of light\". Abraham's guttural howl is a great equalizer of lyrics but the sung sections reveal the words awkwardness Lines such as drips like paint from heaven A shining pall on the horizon\, are easier to get away with screamed than chirped. Fucked Up's blog describes the second side of Year of the Tiger as weird rager\, which is about right. It appears to be a full-on 22-minute instrumental palindrome a pyramidal stack of drones and riffs with a crashing forward-and-backward beat- the closest thing they've ever produced to Melvins more extreme recordings or to HÃ1⁄4sker DÃ1⁄4's Reoccurring. For a experiment\, it's exceptionally listenable Again this band is great at arrangements and every five-second segment of this record sounds almost but not quite like the one next to it. If it were in a movie soundtrack it'd have to be in a sequence with a violently strobing red light. It's too much too much too much- exactly what we rely on Fucked Up for that is. Who would ask for anything less.

Any number of guidebooks newspaper articles airline magazine roundups or TV shows can give first-time New York visitors a lengthy eating itinerary. Unfortunately their recommendations aren't always the best. When we hear a tourist tell us that they're planning on going to Norma's for breakfast Magnolia for a late morning snack Lombardi's for lunch Carmine's for dinner and Serendipity 3 for dessert.. well we get a little bit sad inside. NYC is a killer food town those sorts of places don't show you why. The good news Some oft-visited tourist destinations really do have great food. A few may be a little pricey or a little crowded some might not be the uncontested best in their field. But they're all widely known places that shouldn't leave a visitor disappointed. Check out the list—and stay tuned tomorrow for places tourists don't go but should. What tourist spots do you approve of. View Tourist Spots in NYC That Are Actually Good in a larger map.

By Cheryl Shoults Social Media Specialist and Tsion Gonen Chief Strategy Officer. Last week Gartner released the 2011 Magic Quadrant for User Authentication. I sat down with SafeNetâ€TMs VP of Products and Marketing Tsion Gonen to shed some light on SafeNetâ€TMs position in the quadrant and what itâ€TMs all about. In Part 1 of our interview he explained what the Magic Quadrant is and why making the Leaderâ€TMs quadrant is so special. In Part 2 we discussed the authentication landscape as a whole and in this post we talk about SafeNetâ€TMs authentication solution and their place in the world of strong authentication. Tsion SafeNetâ€TMs philosophy is to provide one management system that allows customers to evolve their authentication approach as their needs change without changing their infrastructure. Other vendors provide products but we provide an authentication infrastructure. Weâ€TMre actually quite religious about this. Even though most of our authentication solutions were brought in by acquisitions they are all still managed by a single platform. Gartner specifically cited several areas of strength for SafeNet. Tsion Yes We have a strong belief that customer satisfaction innovative leadership as well as our technology and our product must continue to improve. SafeNet is a data protection company. We provide companies ways to control access to data as well as control and encrypt data itself. Authentication plays a significant role and has a very strong place in the plan. We will continue to evolve to serve our customersâ€TM future security needs. 0. Add New Comment. You must be logged in to post a comment. Danna Bethlehem February 10 2012 10:05 am.

An article this week in the UK’sÂ MailOnline reports how hackers have cracked the latest generation of security devices compromising the accounts of millions of online banking customers. The security devices used by some UK banks appear to be tokens which generate a dynamic one-time passcode Bank customers log onto their bank sites with an OTP instead of using a regular static password. OTP strong authentication is effective in validating the identity of the customer logging onto the online banking site. But it isnâ€TMt enough to validate any transactions that a customer may carry out after logging in. The financial fraud described in the article was the result of Man-in-the-Browser attacks which are caused by malware that has infected a userâ€TMs computer. The malware kicks in after the customer has already logged into the site. It hijacks the online transaction and siphons money into criminal accounts. The attacks show that strong authentication by itself cannot protect online banking customers against fraud resulting from man in the browser attacks. Nevertheless there are ways to prevent this type of attack from being successful. The first is for the customer to validate each and every transaction. This can be achieved if the customer signs the transaction with an electronic signature. Another way of preventing the attack is to bank online from a trusted browser. The trusted browser is stored on a disk-on-key. When the customer wants to bank online they connect the flash drive to their computer and the trusted browser loads. Since the trusted browser is stored in its own secure environment it is not susceptible to malware in the same way that a regular browser is. SafeNet has been saying for quite a time that strong authentication by itself is not enough to protect online transactions. It offers transaction signing and security solutions which are intended specifically to protect against Man-in-the-Browser attacks. These include the SafeNet eToken 3500 token and the SafeNet Trusted Browsing Platform. At the end of the day only transaction security solutions like these combined with strong authentication can offer online banking customers protection against malware.

The smart grid is the first major effort to modernize an energy infrastructure that has remained largely unchanged over the past several decades. Over the past 50 years electricity networks have not kept pace with modern challenges such as. With the evolution of utility consumption production energy companies needed a better way to monitor supply and manage utility systems. First they developed Automatic Meter Reading in the 1980s and over the following decade developed Advanced Metering Infrastructure Security security) which was able to store how electricity was used at various times during the day. This information was invaluable but the last 15 years have brought on even more challenges and demand on utility providers requiring them to add an even more advanced monitoring and communication system. This is called the Smart Grid. Smart grids work with the AMI to create a network of links between customers and utility companies that provides increased insight into and management of energy consumption cost and workload across the entire energy grid. But because energy utilities play such a vital part of our everyday lives smart grid technologies introduce new smart grid security issues and challenges that must be addressed. Implementing a smart grid without proper smart grid protection could result in grid instability loss of private information utility fraud and unauthorized access to energy consumption data. In the upcoming months we will take a good hard look at smart grid technology and security giving you an inside look at how to build secure and manage the smart grid.

By Dave Madden Mark Yakabuski The smart grid is the first major effort to modernize an energy infrastructure that has remained largely unchanged over the past several decades. Over the past 50 years electricity networks have not kept pace with modern challenges such as Security threats from either energy suppliers or cyber attack National goals to employ alternative power generation sources whose intermittent supply makes maintaining stable power significantly more complex Conservation goals that seek to lessen peak demand surges during the day so that less energy is wasted in order to ensure adequate reserves High demand for an electricity supply that is uninterruptible Digitally-controlled devices that can alter the nature of the electrical load and result in electricity demand that is too much for the outdated system. For a simple example timed Christmas lights can present significant surges in demand because they come on at near the same time or a set time. Without the kind of coordination that a smart grid can provide the increased use of such devices lead to electric service reliability problems power quality disturbances blackouts and brownouts. With the evolution of utility consumption production energy companies needed a better way to monitor supply and manage utility systems.

More than seven out of ten resellers are actively discussing with their customers the authentication and protection of their data in the cloud and/or virtual environments. Authentication for mobile devices certificate-based authentication software authentication and secure browser authentication solutions top the list when it comes to customer interest in new authentication technologies. More than 45 percent of responders indicate that customers have expressed interest in these evolving solutions. Sixty-seven percent of resellers are exploring new authentication options and vendors when renewing contracts to meet evolving requirements. More than 50 percent of resellers surveyed are either currently searching or are likely to search for new authentication vendors with which to partner.

By Cheryl Shoults Social Media Specialist and Tsion Gonen Chief Strategy Officer Last week Gartner released the 2011 Magic Quadrant for User Authentication. I sat down with SafeNetâ€TMs VP of Products and Marketing Tsion Gonen to shed some light on SafeNetâ€TMs position in the quadrant and what itâ€TMs all about. In Part 1 of our interview he explained what the Magic Quadrant is and why making the Leaderâ€TMs quadrant is so special. In Part 2 we discussed the authentication landscape as a whole and in this post we talk about SafeNetâ€TMs authentication solution and their place in the world of strong authentication. Q How is SafeNetâ€TMs authentication solution different from the other vendors listed in the Magic Quadrant Tsion SafeNetâ€TMs philosophy is to provide one management system that allows customers to evolve their authentication approach as their needs change without changing their infrastructure. Other vendors provide products but we provide an authentication infrastructure. Weâ€TMre actually quite religious about this. Even though most of our authentication solutions were brought in by acquisitions they are all still managed by a single platform.

By Cheryl Shoults Social Media Specialist Tsion Gonen Chief Strategy Officer This week Gartner released the 2011 Magic Quadrant for User Authentication. I sat down with SafeNetâ€TMs Chief Strategy Officer Tsion Gonen to shed some light on SafeNetâ€TMs position in the quadrant and what itâ€TMs all about. In Part 1 of our interview he explained what the Magic Quadrant is and why making the Leaders quadrant is so special. In this post we talk about the authentication landscape as a whole and SafeNetâ€TMs place in it. Q How is the 2011 Magic Quadrant for User Authentication different from previous years Tsion This is the first year Gartner has done a quadrant for User Authentication which shows a change in the dynamics of the market. We are shifting from the tried-and-true standard of One-Time-Password authentication to a more complex more heterogeneous authentication market. Companies are realizing that there is no size fits allâ authentication solution anymore. They are turning to companies who have a robust management platform and a portfolio of authentication solutions. It also shows that customer satisfaction is king. The traditional revenue leaders were placed in the Challengers quadrant because they paid less attention to customer satisfaction than SafeNet. Q Did the breaches of 2011 help shape the authentication landscape Tsion Absolutely. There were three significant changes in the way people and companies thought about authentication after the breaches last year. First companies realized that no one is immune. Second the industry learned that complacency can hurt. You canâ€TMt stand still and expect things youâ€TMre doing now to work next year. Everything changes and you have to keep up with the threats. And third companies began to understand that no matter what you do on the perimeter you have to protect the data. Itâ€TMs interesting the RSA breach could have caused people to turn away from authentication but instead it brought authentication to top of mind. Companies realized what happens when they donâ€TMt have strong authentication and they started asking questions about how their authentication products are secured. Obviously this brought a lot of replacement business to SafeNet. Stay tuned for the next post as we discuss SafeNetâ€TMs authentication solution and its place in the world of authentication. read more Danna Bethlehem February 10 2012 10:05 am.

Imaging cell cytoskeletons during early embryonic development leads researchers to uncover a new regulator of cell shape. By Cristina Luiggi 9 2012 Cytoskeletal contractions during embryonic development occur long before there are any visible changes in cell shape suggesting something other than actin and myosin contractions trigger the morphogenetic changes that result in the formation of multilayered embryos from single layers of cells according to new research. In a paper published today 9 in Science a research team led by developmental biologist Bob Goldstein at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill presented evidence that the cellular changes that initiate the formation of germ layers are triggered by a novel molecular which anchors the continually contracting network of actomyosin in cells to contact points on neighboring cells. the past couple of years with the imaging and microscopy thatâ€TMs being done people are really starting to appreciate that this process can be really dynamic\,â said Adam Martin a developmental biologist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who was not involved in the research. this study really shows is that you can regulate contractility at the tissue level by regulating the attachment between this contractile machine and the attachment between neighboring cells.â. In the model worm Caenorhabditis elegans the process of gastrulationâ€”when the three germ layers that will give rise to all the tissues and organs become properly positionedâ€”begins around 90 minutes after the first cell division when two cells out of a single layer of 26 begin to shrink on one side and squeeze past their neighboring cells toward the center of the embryo. Goldsteinâ€TMs former graduate student Minna Roh-Johnson initially wanted to visualize the cytoskeletons of C. elegans during this process. However Goldstein was skeptical that Roh-Johnson would learn anything from such an endeavor. just assumed that weâ€TMd look at the actin and myosin and at these cell surfaces shrinking and weâ€TMd see everything moving at once and weâ€TMd be none the wiser\,â Goldstein recalled. Cells internalizing from the surface of a C. elegans embryo. The outer surface of two internalizing cells are shown in blue the myosin motors in green and the plasma membranes in red. Goldstein lab UNC Chapel Hill. But Roh-Johnson proceeded using spinning disk confocal microscopy to visualize cells with a fluorescently labeled cell membrane and myosin particles. As expected she observed the actomyosin networks of the two cells flex and shrink as their outer surfaces began constricting. However when she watched the cells before any change in cell shape began she was surprised to see similar contractions in their cytoskeletons. kept looking earlier and earlier thinking the contractions would stop at some point but they didnâ€TMt\,â she said. when these cells are born they already had these movements occurring which was very unexpected.â. Not only was the cellâ€TMs actin myosin meshwork pulsating shrinking and remodeling itself for more than 20 minutes before any changes in cell shapes were visible it was also doing so at speeds similar to those that occur when the cell does begin to change shape. By cutting into the actin myosin meshwork using a UV laser beam and then measuring the speed at which the network recoiled the researchers also determined that the tensile strength of the network was just as strong at earlier time points before gastrulation. Labeling the outer surface of the cell membranes with quantum dots revealed that they were as dynamic as the cytoskeletons moving along with every contraction. Instead what changed over time was that the cytoskeletal movements of the two worm cells became increasingly linked with the movements of the contact zones shared with neighboring cells. It is this gradual coupling of the actomyosin network with specific cell adhesion points that seems to trigger the shrinking of the cellsâ€TM outer surfaces allowing the cells to squeeze into the center of the embryo. these networks are coming in theyâ€TMre not attached to the cell-cell borders\,â Goldstein explained. we speculate that thereâ€TMs something in between that functions sort of as a clutch.â. Although this molecular clutch remains to be characterized the researcher found that knocking down certain proteins such as cadherin which is involved in cell adhesion and Rac which is involved in intracellular signaling disrupts the process. Because this mechanism is conserved in Drosophila melanogaster Goldstein believes it might extend to other higher organisms and may underlie the formation and closure of the human neural tubeâ€”failure of which is a common birth defect.

Get The Scientist. Zebras may have evolved their striped coat to avoid blood-sucking flies. By Jef Akst 9 2012 Many a fable and tale propose preposterous theories about how the zebra got its stripes but now science has finally provided a possible answer. According to new research published in the Journal of Experimental Biology zebrasâ€TM black-and-white coloration helps protect the equids from blood-sucking horseflies which find the stripes unattractive. Itâ€TMs all about how light is reflected Susanne Akesson from Lund University told BBC Nature. Akesson found that light reflected off black and brown horses is horizontally polarized which was very attractive to flies. a white coat you get unpolarized light\, she explained which doesnâ€TMt adhere to a specific plane. This the flies find less attractive. Given the fliesâ€TM penchant for dark coats Akesson and her colleagues wondered how zebras might fare. They placed boards that were all black all white and black-and-white striped in a field covered them with insect glue then counted the number of flies that got stuck to each. Strikingly the striped board that most closely represented a zebraâ€TMs stripes had the fewest flies. was a surprise because in a striped pattern you still have these dark areas that are reflecting horizontally polarized light\,â Akesson told BBC. the narrower more zebra-like the stripes the less attractive they were to the flies.. The team also put the fly-glue on three differently colored 3-dimensional horse models. Once again the striped model attracted the fewest flies. But whether or not the flies are the true reason for the zebrasâ€TM stripes remains to be seen. all for this explanation to be true the authors would have to show that tabanid fly bites are a major selection pressure on zebras but not on horses and donkeys found elsewhere in the world.. none of which are stripy\, evolutionary biologist Matthew Cob of the University of Manchester told BBC. hunch is that there is not a single explanation and that many factors are involved in the zebra’s stripes.

The proposed institute is the result of a November 2010 recommendation from the Scientific Management Review Board that the NIH should reorganize all substance use abuse and addiction-related research at the Institutes. Both the National Institute on Drug Abuse and the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism will be dissolved and their research programs folded into the new institute. The NIH is asking for comments about scientific opportunities and public health needsâ that should be included in the new Instituteâ€TMs strategic plan. Those comments can be submitted electronically and will be accepted through May 11 2012. The NIH will also conduct a series of public meetings to discuss the new Institute which will be posted on the NIHâ€TMs feedback website. Previous Nutshell. By Hannah Waters.

A new device can detect sounds a million times fainter than the hearing threshold of the human ear. By Megan Scudellari 10 2012 THE DEVICE If a bacterium belches in a petri dish does anyone hear it In the January issue of Physical Review Letters researchers at LMU Munich in Germany describe the worldâ€TMs tiniest earâ€”an apparatus for the ultrasensitive detection of sound. By tracking the displacement of a levitating gold particle trapped in a focused laser beam the team recorded the acoustic vibrations of nearby nanoparticles. The researchers were also able to determine from which direction the sound came. The researchers estimate the nano-ear can detect sound levels as low as -60 decibels making the device a million times more sensitive than human hearing. The Courtesy American Physical Society. WHAT’S NEW Optical tweezersâ€”infrared lasers focused through an optical microscope to trap tiny objectsâ€”are a standard tool used to study cells metal particles DNA and more. Researchers can move the laser beam to pick up and manipulate these objects studying their motion. But the LMU Munich team put the technique to a different use. were wondering what happens if something disturbs this motion for instance a sound wave\,â said first author Alexander Ohlinger. itâ€TMs possible to detect that disturbance we could use optical tweezers as a microphone.â. Ohlinger and colleagues tested their theory in two experiments. First they recorded the trapped particleâ€TMs response to a relatively strong sound sourceâ€”a needle vibrating on a loudspeaker. Next they detected the significantly weaker acoustics of a patch of vibrating gold nanoparticles being heated up by a laser image above. In both instances the acoustic waves were detected accurately. IMPORTANCE The nano-ear could open up a whole new field of microscopy\,â said Ohlinger. Using optical tweezers scientists might be able to listen in on bacteria viruses and even cellular processes like DNA replication and mitosis. The technique is highly accessible as all the tools that were usedâ€”lasers nanoparticles a dark-field microscope and an ordinary video camera to record the movementâ€”can be readily acquired by a lab Ohlinger added. NEEDS IMPROVEMENT Before the technique can be applied to biological systems however work must be done to reduce the signal to noise ratio said Lene Oddershede head of the optical tweezers group at the University of Copenhagen who was not involved in the study. youâ€TMre at the nanoscale noise is a really big player. Itâ€TMs everywhere\,â she said. With the noise-to-signal ratio reported in the paper these extraneous noises could affect the intended measurements. I do believe the signal-to-noise ratio can be improved\,â Oddershede said.Â The LMU Munich team is now performing studies applying the nano-ear to different systems said Ohlinger. They would like to record the sound of micro-sized objects like cells but first have to determine if the technique can record sound waves that are not periodic as in their experiments but random and messy. have to refine our method but in principle we hope that itâ€TMs possible to use in biology\,â said Ohlinger. is all research in progress.â.

Participants at Boston Music Hack Day 2010 will converge to create operational music technologies over a single weekend. of last year's event Rich Orris. Hundreds of music technologists will enter Boston Music Hack Day this weekend and.. okay hundreds of technologists will leave too. Before they do theyâ€TMll spend an action-packed weekend at Microsoftâ€TMs aptly-named New England Research and Development Center inventing building and presenting music apps hardware hacks and art projects.Â The official rules are simple. software hardware art the web. Anything goes as long as it’s music related.. Mere mortals such as myself are often shocked by the pace of innovation these days which is mostly due to the dedication ingenuity and yes occasionally genius of the coders and makers who build the technology we use every day. Music is no exception. At Boston Music Hack Day on October 16th and 17th you can literally see this innovation happen either in person or through a live video stream. There’s even a T-shirt courtesy of a crowdsourced design challenge. So what will you see Lots of smart people building the next generation of smart music applications everything from powerful listening tools you might use every day to completely whimsical creations like The Swinger created at San Francisco’s Music Hack Day which famously enforced a swing beat on hits like Guns N Roses Child O Mine noted by Boing Boing and others). Music Hack Days where technology enthusiasts gather to build both serious creations and off-the-wall apps like The Swinger have sprung up in many of the world’s tech hotspots since the first event was held in London last July. The previous Boston Music Hack Day drew over 350 software wizards hardware tinkerers and members of the press eager to witness the creation of new technologies. Designer Jocelyn Petko of Alburtis Pennsylvania won the 24-hour-long contest to design the T-shirt for Boston Music Hack Day with this design. On Saturday and Sunday participants will build their ideas with each team presenting their creations on Sunday evening in the hopes of winning a variety of prizes. Sponsors of the event include Collecta extensions.fm Microsoft NERD MTV Mozilla MusiXMatch SonicBids SoundCloud TicketFly and The Echo Nest which publishes Evolver.fm. more about the relationship between Evolver.fm and The Echo Nest.. We’re currently witnessing the dawn of another digital music revolution as the media player migrates from hardware to software more specifically to web and mobile apps that apply powerful data APIs to innovative ideas that would never be feasible on a pure hardware level. Hardware interfaces continue to be important but because MP3 players can be code now they have the potential to do a lot more than they could just a few years ago. I was there when Steve Jobs announced the iPod but these days even Steve Jobs knows apps are where the action is. Iâ€TMm not the only one looking forward to seeing this yearâ€TMs creations in all their forms. Hereâ€TMs that livestream link again and to whet your appetite some more photos from last yearâ€TMs event. Stay tuned throughout the weekend for more Boston Music Hack Day coverage following that we will return to our regularly nonscheduled programming. Events News. boston music hack day hackday mhd.

A mere three hours into this yearâ€TMs Boston Music Hack Day a group of hackers who found each other on an IRC channel had already managed to build a system that allows people to create music through gestures while wearing an accelerometer-enabled watch. Robby Grodin a computer science and music technology major at Northeastern University built part of the software in Max/MSP during one of his classes yesterday. This morning while listening to companies at Boston Music Hack Day present APIs for all the hackers to play with Grodin asked via IRC who else wanted to build something with Max/MSP. Among those to respond was freelance hacker Lindsey Mysse whose Texas Instruments EZ430 Chronos watch recently arrived following a lengthy back order. Their team quickly ballooned to a small de facto development group which colonized a at Microsoft’s NERD Center in Boston. None of them expected to have the thing up and running so quickly. Here’s how it works The watch’s accelerometer tracks acceleration in the X Y and Z axes and sends that information via RF to a dongle attached to Mysee’s laptop which then passes it wirelessly to a frequency modulation synthesizer Max/MSP patch on Grodin’s laptop which turns the movements into sound. The X access is the carrier frequency the Y axis is the modulator ratio to the carrier and the Z axis is the index of how many sidebands are generated. However the potential applications go much further. not getting a whole lot of complex sounds just yet but this is just the start\, said Grodin. really want to use it to control sample-rate playback so you could actually be scratching without vinyl. The possibilities are endless because you’re getting three channels of raw MIDI data and that’s something you can do anything with.. Myssse a visual artist who bought the watch to capture the performance of drawing as data figured it would come in pretty handy at Music Hack Day. He was right. I came here of course there are like five new ideas everybody gets excited and we’re figuring out brand new things to do with the accelerometer that I didn’t consider\,â said Mysse. That sort of collaboration between like-minded strangers is at the crux of this event. It would cost over a million dollars to pay all of these developers to work through an entire weekend instead they showed up because by teaming with other hackers with complementary skills they can create fairly complex stuff like this at breakneck speed. Before much of the country had woken up on Saturday morning they built a gesture-controlled music system. want it to be flexible but provide a couple of patches to get the ball rolling so someone can buy the watch put it on pair it with their computer and five minutes later they’re jamming out with no instruments\, said Mysse. current codename is Toscanini and it will be freeware\, stated Grodin.

Search. Music heads have a new way to connect with the artists they love on iOS devices. An alternative to Apple’s Genius music recommendation software Album Scout allows users to discover new music track their artists and share what they find with their friends. The first time you run the app Album Scout automatically grabs information from your iOS device’s library and instantly provides you with a sleek and attractive cover flow displaying newly-released albums from the artists in your collection. We preferred this view to the other option which lets you slide down a list of albums. Tap any album to listen to track previews and see how popular each track is according to the iTunes store. If you like what you hear Album Scout can connect you to iTunes so your shopping spree can begin. Again we liked the cover flow version best but one advantage exists to using list view instead a Greatest Hits filter which helps deals with bands like Journey that tend to release the same songs in multiple collections. In addition to the new releases this app can also enhance the music already stored on your iPhone iPad or iPod Touch. Tapping displays your iOS device’s music collection in an easy-to-navigate format including biographies a list of similar artists and the artist’s top albums all from Last.fm. Helpfully you can choose whether or not to scout a particular artist from your collection or scout artists you like even if their music isn’t on your device. Whatever you find you can share with friends via email text message or Twitter from within the app. The functionality of Tunes Genius on iOS on the other hand is limited to generating playlists from music stored on the device and that’s it. Album Scout developer Matthew Toohey told Evolver.fm developed Album Scout because I kept realizing good albums had slipped past me. I had hoped that Genius would be good for this purpose but I found it was very hit and miss. It kept recommending songs from the past that I had already decided were not to my taste.. good apps need a sharp focus and so I chose to focus only on the discovery of new music. That way you can stay up to date with your musical tastes with Album Scout and Genius can do what it is best at discovering music from the entire catalog.. We had fun discovering music with Album Scout a great app for fans who consistently crave for new music. For $1 you can start scouting too.

SonicLiving hosts demonstrations of how it can embed audio tags in live concerts and television shows on its website below. Audio tags are looking more and more like the new QR code not only are they way less ugly than those jagged black-on-white squares but you don’t need to take a picture of anything in order for them to work. also Shazam and the Super Bowl.. A startup called SonicNotify embeds inaudibly high-pitched audio signals within music or any other audio track. When a compatible app hears that signal it triggers any available smartphone function to link you to websites display text bring up map locations display a photo let you vote on which song a performer plays next and so on. SonicNotify was developed with help from Cantora Records Labs which made its name by funding $400 initially and releasing the band MGMT‘s massively-popular records. As part of its newly-minted technology division Cantora which is also a record label and publishing company is offering $25\,000 to $100\,000 to promising startups among the first of which isÂ SonicNotify. Lady Gaga could have used its technology on her Monster Ball tour Cantora's Jesse Israel specifically mentioned the Monster Ball tour below) but was using the example hypothetically. Evolver.fm regrets the error] and Coachella 2013 and other events are next in line. To interact via SonicNotify fans can useÂ any SonicNotify-enabled app. If you want to see it in action now you can do so with theÂ official Sonic Experiences app. An inaudible signal triggers an option to vote on the crowd's favorite song at a Coldplay show. It worked even through our tiny laptop speakers. transmits a high-frequency sound wave through speakers we can’t hear the frequency but smartphones can hear it so we’re able to unlock content at live events TV shows and through the web\, said Jesse Israel co-founder of Cantora Records Labs a record label atÂ NYC Music Tech Meetup. closed deals deal is not done Israel now says the company is with\" with Lady Gaga for The Monster Ball Tour ran from 2009 to 2011] we’re doing Coachella we’re doing stuff for Fashion Week next week powering 32 stages college sports partnerships with Twitter and Spotify so it’s kind of a cool example of how we’re able to put pieces together and help a technology get off the ground.. Buyers and journalists with the app installed at Fashion WeekÂ will be zapped an image of each model the instant they step onto the catwalk so they can examine the outfits up-close in real time. Similarly impressive capabilities exist within the music realm. Best of all the audience doesn’t even need to be actively running the app in order for it to pick up on those inaudible signals. Sonic we can unlock anything that your iPhone or Android can do as long as the SonicNotify SDK is built into an app that’s running in the background on your phone\, explained Israel. example some of the stuff we’re doing with Gaga is when she is performing mid-set everyone in the arena gets a notification which lets them choose which song she plays for her encore.. Location is also a part of this because each speaker in a venue can transmit a different tone opening up new possibilities for live concert participation along the lines of what we saw withÂ inConcertApp. can also target sections through radius with frequencies so we can have Section C’s phones turn into purple hearts while Section F on the other side of the arena has red squares\, added Israel. According to Israel Cantora’s basic idea is that app developers are not unlike bands in that they might have all the skills in the world but those skills don’t amount to much unless they are properly deployed. The company is currently working with SonicNotify and two other startups and it plans to fund 8 to 10 in total over the next two years.

Obama’s reelection playlist here features not one but two songs by Darius Rucker. That is not what concerns us now as concerning as it is that arguably the most powerful person in the world listens to Hootie. What’s more impressive is the way Obama’s people have embraced social music. This playlist was created about three hours ago and it already has 1808 subscribers within Spotify. That might not sound like a lot but it is. Plenty of people don’t know what Spotify is and if they do they may not know how to subscribe to a playlist. As younger voters grow older and shareable playlists enter the mainstream Spotify and other media sharing sites will likely become a new political battleground. We wonder how long it will take until Romney Gingrich and the rest fire back. If they don’t people might be tempted to make those playlists for them.. oh wait.

The Scottish development team’s latest pug-themed music app released on iTunes on Thursday\,Â sees the return of the pistachio-green space pugs who first charmed us by terraforming planets for beat-generating root vegetables in their popular Pugs Luv Beats game which weÂ reviewed in all its weird glory. Like its predecessor Pug Synth sounds surprisingly good for a cutesy animated iPhone game starring costumed dogs. It expands on one of my favorite features from the original Pugs Luv Beats a touch synthesizer that lets you solo over the planet menu in that game while rifling through compositions. Essentially an X-Y synthesizer pad in disguise an instrument you may already be familiar with Pug Beats features tonal parameters animated with two pugs. Pitch and envelope are controlled by your finger’s position on each respective axis allowing for smooth melodic sweeps through scale presets as you swipe across the screen firing at floating beats look like beets. Each time you play a note a stream of hearts emanates from the pugs mouths. So yeah pretty standard synth stuff. Pug Synth finds even more unusual ways of combining gameplay and music-making. You can select different backing loops by dressing one or both pugs in hats. The free app comes with a construction helmet and shark fin with more hats and thus more loop styles available for a buck through in app purchase. Tapping the snare drum icon starts or stops the backing loop. Meanwhile dressing the pugs in different costumes course!. alters their sound by cycling through synth presets. Because you have two pugs to work with in this version Pug Synth allows for polyphonic duets when swiping with two fingers at once. This app also picks up where Pugs Luv Beats left off with tonal and tempo controls allowing users to alter mode chromatic key and beats-per-minute from the settings menu. With this simple app Lucky Frame expands on what it did best in Pugs Luv Beats repackaging an intuitive synthesizer in an unintimidating charming user-friendly interface. As a coworker noted the pugs could really be anything came to mind. But like the cheesed-off birds that made Rovio‘s Angry Birds such a classic these pugs bring a flash of character that makes this weird little app all the more memorable.

Apple’s AirPlay gives people the pleasure of watching movies looking at photos and of course listening to music wirelessly zapping the contentÂ from their iPhones iPod Touches or iPads to their televisions and home speaker systems with a variety of popular iOS music apps. What about Google’s Android devices do those work with AirPlay too Last year Evolver.fm reported that Apple’s wireless music influence was in fact starting to be felt on Android. Meanwhile\,Â Google’s competing Fling platform has effectively been a non-starter. We’ve since seen a slow but steady rise in Android apps that stream music to Apple TV\,Â Airport Express andÂ AirPlay-compatible speakers and sound systems.Â Google should be worried. This is how people develop a taste for Apple. That’s their problem. To help Android owners who want in on wireless home music without waiting for Google to get its act together here are the best Android apps for streaming music to Apple’s AirPlay devices. Eye-C Taglists. Taglists by Eye-C The first Android AirPlay app to catch our attention thisÂ multi-platform app builds on Twitter hash tags to create playlists out of music on YouTube SoundCloud and elsewhere and share them on your social networks. That’s a fairly simple and ingenious idea but we mention it here because Eye-C also makes it easy to play these playlists on AirPlayÂ speakers and other devices. Remote For iTunes Apple’s own Remote app for iPhone and iPadÂ is popular in part because it controls music on computers running iTunes and can extend that music to AirPlay devices too all without music fans ever touching their computers. Developer Hyperfine developed an Apple Remote counterpart for Android Windows Phone that does pretty much the same thing. Using its sleek black layout you can search and play iTunes music on a computer from your Android. Bonus It also controls volume on multiple AirPlay devices individually. iMediaShare. iMediaShare Lots of apps can stream via AirPlay as we’ve seen but some also include content from a range of media properties built right in. Developer Bianor created an app that acts sort of like a remote control that’s also the cable box so you can switch between between online channels your Android’s music library and other media services and stream any of it to AirPlay. The channel-surfing interface feels like the iPhone’s or Android’s graphical list of app icons with a nice selection The Onion CNN Animal Planet etc.. All of this is playable on a long list of hardware thanks to DLNA game consoles XBox 360) televisions Sony etc.). audio home electronics Onkyo etc.). and of course any Airplay-enabled device. It’s a monstrous app. Twonky PacketVideo’s Twonky comes in two flavors. Twonky Mobile resembles iMediaShare in that it’s an all-inclusive streaming app for music video and photos to lots of different devices but with a different look and feel. Then there’s Twonky Music which works as a conduit for your Android’s music collection or your favorite web radio sources to any AirPlay or DLNA-enabled device. While it’s lighter on the features than Twonky Mobile Twonky Music has its own special bonuses the feature is one of the tastiest with artist information biographies lyrics and news. It’s a nice feature for those who want to find out more about what they’re listening to without switching apps. AirBubble Bubblesoft’s offering does something a little different It works in reverse to the way these other apps work. Instead of sending music from Android to AirPlay devices basically acts as an AirPlay receiver. Connect your Android to some speakers fire up AirBubble and you can stream from iTunes or any other AirPlay-enabled streamer even an iPhone to your sound system. Honey Player As its developer rich high puts it this is sweetest player for Android with Airplay. It’s exactly that nice sweet and useful. This simple and effective music player streams music from your Android’s music library to any AirPlay device without a lot of extra bells and whistles. Its classy and enjoyable layout lets you can choose some music pick the output and rate your music with ease. If it’s you’re after you just found it.

Vincent Morisset bills himself as a director which is a fitting distinction. Where most films progress in a linear fashion Morisset takes things a step further or maybe sideways. Through simple interactions like scrolling a mouse across a computer screen or complicated ones like dancing in front of a webcam Morisset’s films ask the audience to participate in an unfolding narrative. His approach is tailor-made for web 2.0. Just as Facebook and Twitter are only worthwhile when users get involved Morisset’s work truly comes alive only with audience input. Readers may know Morisset’s work through his involvement with the Grammy-winning band Arcade Fire with whom he has worked since their 2004 breakout album Funeral. Since then he’s created music videos interactive web content and the 2009 documentary Mirroir Noir alongside the band. Most recently he directed the beautifully unsettling video for Sprawl II Beyond Mountains)\, Arcade Fire’s latest single. The video presents characters whose behaviors mimic that of the viewer. Dance quickly to the music and the characters will do the same slow down and they’ll follow suit. If you stop dancing altogether the characters stop progressing their movements stuck in an endless loop. Morisset has also worked with Icelandic post-rockers Sigur Ros directing that band’s concert film Inni which may be a traditional film though the methods of its creation were anything but. He shot and edited the movie in digital HD then transferred it to black-and-white film by projecting it onto a screen and recording that projection with 16mm cameras. The 16mm version of the movie was then itself projected as Morisset and his collaborators improvised manipulations using and other found objects. Then they filmed and edited that version using digital HD equipment. The result was uncanny promotional materials accurately describe it as and near-monochromatic in its tunnel visionâ€¦[inviting both intimacy and claustrophobia. We recently spoke with Morisset about the ideas behind his work collaborating with musicians and his complicated relationship with technology. interview has been edited for length and clarity.. Andy Cush Evolver.fm I wanted to start by asking you about your background especially the interactive side of your art. How did you come to work in this particular format. Vincent Morisset Director When I was younger I wanted to go into cinema so I went to school in that direction. When I was in university I was in this communication program. You had to decide whether to go into TV cinema or radio. The year I had to choose my profile they opened up this new program called multimedia and it just fit with my personality. I’m a guy who can touch every aspect of it and so I jumped in that program. This was in the late so my path kind of changed at that point. For a couple of years I’d been mainly developing graphic-based websites because at that time that was the limitation of the medium. In the beginning of the the bandwidth allowed us to play more and more with video so at that point my two loves if I may say joined back together. I started to do more and more video-based projects. I was part of a team with other people and I was the guy that was more comfortable with technology. I don’t consider myself a geek. I don’t love programming but I learned how to code in Lingo and in ActionScript to make projects happen. So I have this kind of self-taught programming background but at the same time I studied cinema. At some point those two backgrounds collided and I started doing what we now call interactive video. Evolver.fm Do you see the technology as worth pursuing on it’s own making something with the most high-tech tools available Or is it more of a means to achieve an artistic vision. Morisset I’m not a geek. I’m not really excited about the technology its own sake. I think it offers amazing possibilities but I’m not one of those guys who get excited just because of it. Ideas always drive my projects and I use the tools that are around me to achieve them. I think it’s important that we understand the possibilities and the limitations of those tools but for me it’s important that the projects are driven by ideas so that they don’t become technology demos or whatever. Evolver.fm A lot of your work though technologically impressive manages to feel very handmade and human the animations in the interactive film Bla Bla for instance or the homespun quality of this newest Arcade Fire video II\". Morisset Thanks. I think there’s a paradox about my relationship with technology. In a way I love it. One of my mottos is web is fun. I love this platform I love this medium but the way we connect with images on our laptop is really different from the way we relate to images on a TV screen. Since I want to trigger emotions through my projects I work hard so that we kind of forget that we’re in front of a computer. We forget about the technology and it just feels like a kind of weird magical thing reacting to what you do. Evolver.fm Would you talk a little bit about the II video your processes behind it and how it came to be. Morisset I’ve been working with the band forever back since Funeral so we have this ongoing creative collaboration going on. When they were recording The Suburbs\,Â I was working as artistic director on the whole visual aspect of the artwork juggling different ideas for various projects. For a while I wanted to develop an interactive video project that would be free of any interface just this thing that’s really spontaneous and primitive. I showed this really basic little demo to Regine Arcade Fire's singer/multi-instrumentalist] where you just waved your hand at the webcam and it triggered sounds and flickered the screen. She said she thought they’d have a song that was a little more pop the kind of song you could dance to and that she’d play it for me when it was done. At the end it ended up being Sprawl II. It was kind of disco-ish and for me it fit perfectly with the concept. So time passed I worked on other projects and at the end of the album cycle I was like we should really do this.. The band was totally into doing a dance-activated video but they wanted to make sure people without a webcam or a good computer would still be able to have a sense of the world we were creating so we decided to do a kind of hybrid project. We would have a traditional film that could be seen on YouTube or on TV and parallel to that would be this interactive video. That was kind of a challenge because out of the same shoot I had to do two parallel projects for two totally different mediums. Evolver.fm Thematically the album seems conflicted about the state of modern life as we know it and your video dovetails nicely with that. You created these images that at times almost feel like home video and presented them in a new confusing context. A still from Morisset's interactive video for Sprawl II. Morisset We wanted to have something that would be really simple and straightforward but not boring. So we asked ourselves what we like about music videos and decided to make something that felt spontaneous and fun with a bit of strangeness added. It’s always funny when I first show the project to different kinds of people. When they start to understand the cause and effect of their gestures and the echo in the choreography there’s this moment when they’re like They get a bit freaked out. And then when you pass this moment you kind of assimilate it and make the video your own. It’s funny how different people interact with it depending on their personality or their cultural background. Some people are more analytical about it some people just let loose. It’s funny to see how people connect with a piece like that. Evolver.fm The interactivity makes it just as much about whatever baggage you’re bringing to the table as a spectator as it is about what the artist put into it. Morisset It also connects to what the song is about. There’s this character alienated by her environment who wants to get loose and escape from that alienating environment. The fact that you dance in front of your computer is also a bit liberating and kind of weird because you’re not in a context where you normally dance. You’re at your work computer or in your living room and there’s this moment where you cross a tiny boundary. Evolver.fm One of the criticisms you often hear about internet culture is that it causes people to have short attention spans about the media they consume. Because your interactive work is mostly experienced online by its nature\,Â there’s a good chance some people won’t give it their full attention and others will perceive it as frivolous. Does that bother you at all. Morisset No not at all. I like this gray area about music video culture. There’s something really exciting about that niche because you’re juggling between two worlds. You connect to a broad audience but you’re able to propose things that are unusual and sometimes a bit challenging. It’s okay if people see it one way or another. It’s part of the process part of the game. I quite like the fact that we are able to reach all kinds of people and present it in different contexts. At some point you don’t have control over what contexts the piece will be re-presented in so you don’t know how people will look at it. And I think that’s kind of cool. Evolver.fm Yeah that must be pretty exciting. Just releasing it into the wild. Morisset You need to embrace that. It’s part of what the web is. Evolver.fm There seems to be a connection with music in a lot of your work even the stuff that isn’t commissioned by a band. When you began your career as an artist did you know that you’d have this close relationship with music Or is that something that evolved on its own. Morisset Your life is about accidents happy accidents. The fact that I started to work with Arcade Fire something like eight years ago it led me to doing projects that bounced into other projects and other projects and other people asking me to work with them. In the last years I’ve just been lucky enough to work with amazing artists. I would say it’s been this kind of theory of encounters. I didn’t look to do just music-related projects it just kind of happened like that. And I must say I decided that in the next year I’d like to explore other things.Â But I love music and I think there’s a strong connection between music and image especially for interactive stuff. When you’re playing with non-linear editing the music gives the thing a kind of emotional spine. It gives it a structure. Even if you’re playing with something that’s really reactive at least you have this backbone to keep the tension and dramatic crescendos of a piece. So it’s something really useful for me as an artist working with interactive material but I don’t way to be pigeonholed to do music stuff. Like I said before I like to touch all kinds of things. Evolver.fm Something that attracted me to Inni was the hands-on analog manipulation of the film that you guys were doing. You’re taking something that was originally filmed digitally in HD and working with it like you would with clay or paint as a physical artistic object. Could you explain that process. Morisset I see that as a traditional film. It’s linear and about an hour long but I took a lot of the expertise that I developed with web projects into that process. I’m always trying to destroy the slick perfect a bit soulless look of computer-ish imagery. In Bla Bla it was the same. I did some old school stop motion with a puppet then rotoscoped the face in 3D so that I could map the mouth and the eyes in real time. So again I was working with something that was really fragile and imperfect but using sophisticated technology along with it. With Inni it’s kind of the other way around. We took advantage of these really light-sensitive cameras and were able to edit the film in a straightforward efficient way. But there was this too-crisp feel to it it was almost like watching the news on TV. It kind of killed all the magic and the aura of what Sigur Ros is. So I thought we’d try a more spontaneous approach with the post-production. When I pitched the idea to Sigur Ros I was comparing it to when Neil Young did the Dead Man soundtrack. He sat in front of the Jim Jarmusch film with his guitar looking at it for the first time and just jammed over it. There’s this really volatile imperfect thing about it that makes it so alive and beautiful. Again computers can do amazing things but there’s something about organic handmade stuff. You can’t fake it. You just need to put your hands in the dirt and do it. Evolver.fm Tell me about your synchronized artwork for The Suburbs. Morisset Well I think there’s a lot of potential in this really straightforward way of presenting digital content synchronized with the song. It struck me that more people haven’t embraced this path. I was like I thought it was such a cool idea. Why aren’t other people doing it It’s kind of a no-brainer. It makes no sense that in 2012 we’re still stuck with a JPEG for the whole album. It’s bizarre. It’s been blocked by Apple in a way. It couldn’t be sold in their store because it’s not standard MP3s but it’s not exactly an app either. Evolver.fm It reminds me a little bit of BjÃ¶rk’s Biophilia suite of apps. Obviously they’re very different but they seem of a piece in a way because both are looking at the album format and asking could we be doing differently in 2012?. Morisset With the BjÃ¶rk thing you need to get into the app to listen to the song. You’re kind of forced to be involved in it. For me listening to music is something that can go both ways. I can remember sitting on the couch when I was younger and opening the vinyl sleeve and reading the lyrics. But when I’m on the bus I don’t want to have to hold the record sleeve. I want to put it on sleep put it in my pocket and still be able to listen to it. I still want to put it on random with other songs I still want to be able to put those tracks in a playlist. The BjÃ¶rk thing is cool in itself but I would love it if it could be embedded in your listening environment. If you’re in that you can’t do anything else. If you listen to the app album you’re in that so you have your virtual booklet open at all times. Evolver.fm Have you seen any interactive work for bands that other people are doing that inspires you. Morisset It’s not interactive but I do likeÂ Radio Soulwax. It’s a set of mixtapes with evolving artwork. Evolver.fm Is there anything happening in the world of more mainstream narrative film that’s got you excited Is that a world that you would ever consider trying to work in. Morisset I’m embracing traditional linear films. I’ve done two films so it’s not a world I’m totally unfamiliar with.Â One thing I think is exciting is how those films get around now. I think we’re on the verge of changing distribution and how we consume films so films that are a bit more niche are able to reach an audience more easily. I think Mirroir Noir the Arcade Fire documentary was one of the first feature films to be originally distributed online. When it first came out the only way you could see it was to buy it online and download the HD video.Â It was a bit peculiar no film festivals no theater screenings. At the end I think it was successful because we were able to reach in a single day the whole fan community. And people just wanted to see that film. I think if we had gone down the traditional path people would have found a torrent of it not because they wanted to pirate they just wanted to see it so badly. So in a way we short-circuited the threat and in a way that was good. After that the film got screened at some theaters and some film events. So the film’s life was inverted but in a good way.

The following interview with Spotify CEO Daniel Ek originally appeared on GRAMMY.com. Ek will give the keynote address at the GRAMMY Foundationâ€TMs Entertainment Law Initiative Luncheon Scholarship Presentation on Feb. 10 in Beverly Hills Calif. For more information on the GRAMMY Foundation visit www.grammyfoundation.org. The 54th Annual GRAMMY Awards airs live on Sunday Feb. 12 on CBS. Eliot Van Buskirk Evolver.fm It’s been about a year since we last met. How are things going with you lately. Daniel Ek CEO Spotify I’ve got a bit of a sore throat right now if you’re asking about me personally but Spotify is doing fantastic. That’s always great. Evolver.fm Can you give us a preview of what you intend to discuss at the GRAMMY Foundation’s Entertainment Law Initiative Luncheon. Ek There’s a lot of interesting debate going on now about streaming and I like that it’s become more about streaming and not what’s free or not. But what I really want to talk about is the future. We have this debate about where it is right now but I still think streaming is really in its infancy and I want to outline the future of what that looks like what it will actually mean for the music industry. What would it mean for how to promote an act Or for revenues. We’re at a time now when more and more people are saying actually this is working\, and we’ve got two-and-a-half million paying customers and that number is growing very very quickly and it keeps accelerating. Personally speaking I am more bullish on the future of the music industry than ever before and I think we’re kind of entering a golden age in music. Evolver.fm:Â What will that golden age look like. Spotify gets political as Barack Obama's reelection campaigners posted a Spotify playlist featuring their favorite songs including some of the president's. Ek:Â First I think we’re talking about a world where I believe most of it will be access. There will be ownership as well. I think the total amount of revenues back to the industry is going to grow. We’ve paid over $200 million to rightsholders already and it’s still in the early days. So for me part of it is talking about the growth story of how we get the music industry back to where it used to be and probably even past that. The second part is in a world where music is really about you listening to music and your friends discovering it from you what does that mean about how we break acts and promote acts Spotify up until now hasn’t really done a great job of helping that but you’re going to see us doing more and more to break acts and try to really promote them as well. Looking at Spotify today and fast-forwarding three years to 2015 Where’s the music industry Where’s Spotify and what does this mean to a band manager or label I think it’s exciting times. Creating a record is really about three core components. The first thing is creating the actual record. It used to be really expensive to do that and now really anyone can record a record even their own homes. The second piece is that it used to be really expensive distributing the record and now with iTunes Spotify and other services distributing another digital copy basically doesn’t cost anything. But the funny thing is marketing used to be kind of simple in the old days. You used to be able to just put it on the radio or MTV and it just worked. If it was a good song the record started selling based on that. Today the media landscape is much more fragmented. MTV’s not about music anymore and radio is even hard[er to break through. There are tons of radio channels and most of them play stuff people already know. So marketing an act today is really really really expensive. If it went from being a broadcast medium of just getting it out there to everyone to a social medium where music is discovered through friends what does that mean for the marketing of music I think that’s core component of getting this to work. Evolver.fm:Â That’s a really good point. I guess we’re also seeing that with some of the audio ads within Spotify which are clips of songs. Ek:Â Hopefully I’ll also be able to go into some interesting things we’ve seen my address] especially with Facebook where there are acts like Foster The People who kind of blew up on the service really because friends started discovering from other people. That’s a great story for us to show this works. People discovered it not just through radio where they didn’t have much promotion but because friends kept recommending and listening to it so their friends in turn discovered it.. Evolver.fm:Â Is that part of the decision to require a Facebook login on Spotify because you see the social sharing as so important. Ek We look at the sharing of music as really really important for our business. We’ve found that the more social our users are i.e. they’re sharing music the faster they grow their own music library. the faster they grow their music library the faster they become paying customers. That’s really the rationale for us not really the marketing side but we feel that the combination of and Spotify is a positive thing. Evolver.fm:Â I remember when we first met in New York years ago and you said that you wanted to create a legal version of the sort of experience that people have in the P2P version. My favorite thing about Napster was searching for one rare band that I loved. If someone had that then I trusted them and knew that I was going to like anything else they had. Ek:Â Yep. Evolver.fm:Â It seems like you have succeeded in translating that to a legal music service so congratulations on that. Ek:Â Yes we’ve done that. Right now it’s skewed more toward your friends. What we want to make it skew toward is you discovering other people with great music taste as well. Evolver.fm:Â Are there any misunderstandings about Spotify that you’d like to clear up. Ek:Â I feel to an extent that we’re a victim of our own success. What I mean by that is especially if you look at the media Spotify is seen as this gigantic company the size of iTunes which is not really true. We’re really starting up here and that’s how we feel about it. If you look at a country like the U.S. there’s sub-1 percent of the population that’s even using any legal streaming service. I think that sometimes people perceive us as being a lot larger than we are and that’s an important point to make. Spotify CEO Daniel Ek unveils the company's app strategy at a New York event Eliot Van Buskirk. point I want to make is that this is a very very different model than just selling a record. Everyone talks about volume and what this means in terms of numbers and I don’t think it’s comparable. In the world today there are 500 million people listening to music online. Out of them there’s only a very small portion who are avid iTunes customers which we look at today as being the majority of the digital music ecosystem. So the way we’re approaching this is we want to reach the 500 million people of whom the vast majority aren’t really using iTunes. I’d also like to address people who think they’ll gain sales by not being on Spotify. There’s not a shred of data to suggest that. In fact all the information available points to streaming services helping to drive sales. Album unit sales up in the U.S. in 2011 the year Spotify launched for the first time since 2004. More than a dozen albums which debuted at number one have been available on Spotify at launch. Spotify users are the exact same people used to listen to music every day on YouTube whose entire music collection was pulled off BitTorrent sites. By offering them a compelling music service that allows them to discover hundreds of new artists not just their favorites pulled from YouTube or we’re seeing millions move back to listening to music legally after years of being left out in the cold. They’re helping pay a ton of money back to the industry. You’re talking 10 million active users 2.5 million subscribers most of them paying $120 a year which is double the amount of your average iTunes user. Do you really want to hold back your album from people who are finally paying for music again If you think that by doing so you’re getting them to buy your album on a CD or as an album download again there’s absolutely no evidence to back that theory up. Your album’s getting shared en masse over BitTorrent over YouTube. It’s there right now but you decide that it’s the paying loyal music fans that should lose out. It makes no sense. Another thing I want to mention When someone creates a Spotify playlist and they put an album or songs in there they don’t just play them once. What actually happens is they keep repeatedly playing them. What I think is interesting and what we do here that the sales cycle of that record is anywhere from four to 12 weeks in most typical cases. With Spotify we keep seeing the effect up to 25 35 or even a year. So when looking at the effect a certain record release has one in the world of Spotify has to look not just at the first 12 weeks but actually look at six months and probably even a year after because it keeps playing. And every time someone plays a song we pay the music industry. I think that is probably the biggest misunderstanding everyone keeps comparing an apple to what’s actually not an apple but hopefully a tastier fruit. Evolver.fm:Â It seems like that would give musicians an incentive to make music that people want to listen to over and over again which could be good culturally. It’s not just about making a splash. Ek:Â Yeah At Spotify we really want you to democratically win as a musician. We want you to win because your music is the best music. And the only way you can win in the Spotify ecosystem unless you buy advertising is by friends recommending to other friends. And they do so by listening to your music. They vote with their hands and feet. I think that’s a pretty great thing for an artist that’s creating great music. What’s interesting to me looking at the greatest acts of last year is that many of those acts are acts that five or 10 years ago may not have even had a record deal but they’ve grown one of my favorite bands Mumford Sons. I don’t know how much been growing on social but I can tell you the reason why I discovered them was someone actually sent me a YouTube clip and then I started searching for them on Spotify and I discovered this fantastic band. I guess the point is that in the future we’re getting more and more connected all over the world and hopefully that will mean that great music will prevail because your friends will listen to it and share it with other friends. Spotify can send music via Apple AirPlay to home stereos and other devices. Evolver.fm:Â The two big areas for growth in digital music seem to be the car and the television. What can you tell us about Spotify’s strategy there. Ek:Â Much like we believe a strength of the CD being ubiquitous that you can take a CD and put it in any player and just press play that’s how easy we want it to be to play music with Spotify. As more and more devices are getting connected the base of people who will want to listen to music with those devices will increase and that’s something we’re hugely excited Evolver.fm:Â To switch gears for a second I was very interested to cover what Spotify is doing with apps. You can build desktop apps on Spotify’s catalog iOS apps and now you can build apps within the Spotify desktop client. How significant do you see that ecosystem Is it going to be a major part of Spotify’s growth in the future. Ek:Â Yeah we definitely do believe that. There are multiple ways one can look at this but what we’re trying to primarily address is that when it comes to music we’ve got 15 or 16 million tracks. I don’t even know what the exact number is but there’s an endless amount of music. You could listen your whole life to the Spotify catalog and you probably wouldn’t get through a third of it. What’s needed on top of that is curated experiences. Part of that curated experience is people building playlists and sharing those playlists with their friends. But another part is trusted sources people who tend to be really really good at music. There are things you can with music that aren’t Spotify’s core like lyrics ticketing and other things. We felt that the Internet really was silent and that music was missing. We wanted to create a platform to allow people to interact with music whether that’s providing curation or providing more interesting experiences or even using that to give you other venues such as ticketing and merchandising. We think all of those things are super exciting but they’re not our core competency. We might have 100 or 150 engineers and that’s great but already now with the Spotify platform we’ve got thousands of engineers working on creating more interesting music experiences. And that’s ultimately really good for the music industry because there are more avenues now to listen to music and interact with music. Ultimately that’s going to make more people care about music and pay for it again. Spotify runs on the iPad and many other devices courtesy of Flickr/Andreas Blixt. Evolver.fm:Â We’ve talked a little bit about the royalty payouts. Some people have said from time to time that the payouts are too low and others point out that with hundreds of millions of dollars changing hands how can that be low A few artists are deciding not to have releases on Spotify so I guess one conclusion to draw would be that it’s too difficult to do freemium streaming to pay what seem like very high royalties in one sense but on a per-artist level some people say it’s not very much. How do you see this playing out. Ek:Â As I said a lot of people try to compare an apple to another fruit and as I started out saying we look at it as us being in our infancy. We haven’t even started really. We’re still a really young company. So ultimately our view is that the royalty checks we’re paying out now of course we’re happy that there’s progress being made but it’s still only in its early days and it will keep growing. Last year was a great testament to that in May we hit a million paying customers and at the end of that year we were at two-and-a-half million. That’s a significant increase in customers who are paying 100 bucks a year. And Spotify keeps growing at that pace if not faster. So I think the royalty checks as they’re combined will definitely grow. But I also want to kind of caution people. We get a lot of media attention. People think we’re actively seeking that media attention and in most instances we’re not. People just like the product so much that they like to write about it. I find this when I meet artists. They actually think we’re a lot larger than we are. I say we’re not really. We’re roughly 10 million users in countries where in total there are 600 million people. And out of them at least 250 million are listening to music online so we’re actually a very small part of this right now.. I want to add that my home country Sweden where Spotify has grown to scale if you look at the artists now the vast majority of the artists are getting between 50 and 60 percent of all their income from Spotify. And I think that’s what’s going to happen when this model gets to scale. And the music industry Sweden is growing. Evolver.fm:Â The latest thing with Spotify and Facebook is this ability to listen to the same thing at the same time which I think is a fantastic feature. It makes music not only something between a person an MP3 player and a pair of headphones. Over the long term is this going to become a mainstream activity or is it just for people like me who use the latest stuff and get a kick out of it. Ek:Â Our approach is that we don’t know. With that said we think music is the most social thing there is and we think people want to interact with music. The background on that feature is that it was actually built by Facebook which we think is cool. One of the engineers there showed it to me one time when I came to visit and he was like do you think about this?. I said is awesome you should just release it.. The coolest thing is that he could build that feature because Spotify is a platform so he could interact with our APIs create it and put it on the service. We didn’t actually interact that much to get this done but it was one of the things that the Facebook folks were really passionate about and I think I hope and I believe that there will be 10 other projects similar to this around the Web right now where people build cool interesting experiences. Two weeks ago someone created the Spotify app Soundrop released their own iOS app. So now all of a sudden I have a room where I’m walking around and people talk about music where they vote for which track will come next. It’s kind of a social radio. And that was built by two guys in Oslo. I guess the answer is that we don’t know what will work or not but we’re thrilled that people want to innovate around it. Evolver.fm:Â So do you still find time to play guitar. Ek:Â I do I actually bought a travel guitar and that guitar is really cool. You can actually fold the guitar and you can plug headphones into it but it’s acoustic or semi-acoustic. So I do more actually than I did last year.

An alternative to Apple’s Genius music recommendation software Album Scout allows users to discover new music track their artists and share what they find with their friends. The first time you run the app Album Scout automatically grabs information from your iOS device’s library and instantly provides you with a sleek and attractive cover flow displaying newly-released albums from the artists in your collection. We preferred this view to the other option which lets you slide down a list of albums. Tap any album to listen to track previews and see how popular each track is according to the iTunes store. If you like what you hear Album Scout can connect you to iTunes so your shopping spree can begin. Again we liked the cover flow version best but one advantage exists to using list view instead a Greatest Hits filter which helps deals with bands like Journey that tend to release the same songs in multiple collections. In addition to the new releases this app can also enhance the music already stored on your iPhone iPad or iPod Touch. Tapping displays your iOS device’s music collection in an easy-to-navigate format including biographies a list of similar artists and the artist’s top albums all from Last.fm. Helpfully you can choose whether or not to scout a particular artist from your collection or scout artists you like even if their music isn’t on your device. Whatever you find you can share with friends via email text message or Twitter from within the app. The functionality of Tunes Genius on iOS on the other hand is limited to generating playlists from music stored on the device and that’s it. Album Scout developer Matthew Toohey told Evolver.fm developed Album Scout because I kept realizing good albums had slipped past me. I had hoped that Genius would be good for this purpose but I found it was very hit and miss. It kept recommending songs from the past that I had already decided were not to my taste.. good apps need a sharp focus and so I chose to focus only on the discovery of new music. That way you can stay up to date with your musical tastes with Album Scout and Genius can do what it is best at discovering music from the entire catalog.. We had fun discovering music with Album Scout a great app for fans who consistently crave for new music. For $1 you can start scouting too.

Apple’s AirPlay gives people the pleasure of watching movies looking at photos and of course listening to music wirelessly zapping the contentÂ from their iPhones iPod Touches or iPads to their televisions and home speaker systems with a variety of popular iOS music apps. What about Google’s Android devices do those work with AirPlay too Last year Evolver.fm reported that Apple’s wireless music influence was in fact starting to be felt on Android. Meanwhile\,Â Google’s competing Fling platform has effectively been a non-starter. We’ve since seen a slow but steady rise in Android apps that stream music to Apple TV\,Â Airport Express andÂ AirPlay-compatible speakers and sound systems.Â Google should be worried. This is how people develop a taste for Apple. That’s their problem. To help Android owners who want in on wireless home music without waiting for Google to get its act together here are the best Android apps for streaming music to Apple’s AirPlay devices. Eye-C Taglists. Taglists by Eye-C The first Android AirPlay app to catch our attention thisÂ multi-platform app builds on Twitter hash tags to create playlists out of music on YouTube SoundCloud and elsewhere and share them on your social networks. That’s a fairly simple and ingenious idea but we mention it here because Eye-C also makes it easy to play these playlists on AirPlayÂ speakers and other devices. Remote For iTunes Apple’s own Remote app for iPhone and iPadÂ is popular in part because it controls music on computers running iTunes and can extend that music to AirPlay devices too all without music fans ever touching their computers. Developer Hyperfine developed an Apple Remote counterpart for Android Windows Phone that does pretty much the same thing. Using its sleek black layout you can search and play iTunes music on a computer from your Android. Bonus It also controls volume on multiple AirPlay devices individually. iMediaShare. iMediaShare Lots of apps can stream via AirPlay as we’ve seen but some also include content from a range of media properties built right in. Developer Bianor created an app that acts sort of like a remote control that’s also the cable box so you can switch between between online channels your Android’s music library and other media services and stream any of it to AirPlay. The channel-surfing interface feels like the iPhone’s or Android’s graphical list of app icons with a nice selection The Onion CNN Animal Planet etc.. All of this is playable on a long list of hardware thanks to DLNA game consoles XBox 360) televisions Sony etc.). audio home electronics Onkyo etc.). and of course any Airplay-enabled device. It’s a monstrous app. Twonky PacketVideo’s Twonky comes in two flavors. Twonky Mobile resembles iMediaShare in that it’s an all-inclusive streaming app for music video and photos to lots of different devices but with a different look and feel. Then there’s Twonky Music which works as a conduit for your Android’s music collection or your favorite web radio sources to any AirPlay or DLNA-enabled device. While it’s lighter on the features than Twonky Mobile Twonky Music has its own special bonuses the feature is one of the tastiest with artist information biographies lyrics and news. It’s a nice feature for those who want to find out more about what they’re listening to without switching apps. AirBubble Bubblesoft’s offering does something a little different It works in reverse to the way these other apps work. Instead of sending music from Android to AirPlay devices basically acts as an AirPlay receiver. Connect your Android to some speakers fire up AirBubble and you can stream from iTunes or any other AirPlay-enabled streamer even an iPhone to your sound system. Honey Player As its developer rich high puts it this is sweetest player for Android with Airplay. It’s exactly that nice sweet and useful. This simple and effective music player streams music from your Android’s music library to any AirPlay device without a lot of extra bells and whistles. Its classy and enjoyable layout lets you can choose some music pick the output and rate your music with ease. If it’s you’re after you just found it.

Vincent Morisset bills himself as a director which is a fitting distinction. Where most films progress in a linear fashion Morisset takes things a step further or maybe sideways. Through simple interactions like scrolling a mouse across a computer screen or complicated ones like dancing in front of a webcam Morisset’s films ask the audience to participate in an unfolding narrative. His approach is tailor-made for web 2.0. Just as Facebook and Twitter are only worthwhile when users get involved Morisset’s work truly comes alive only with audience input. Readers may know Morisset’s work through his involvement with the Grammy-winning band Arcade Fire with whom he has worked since their 2004 breakout album Funeral. Since then he’s created music videos interactive web content and the 2009 documentary Mirroir Noir alongside the band. Most recently he directed the beautifully unsettling video for Sprawl II Beyond Mountains)\, Arcade Fire’s latest single. The video presents characters whose behaviors mimic that of the viewer. Dance quickly to the music and the characters will do the same slow down and they’ll follow suit. If you stop dancing altogether the characters stop progressing their movements stuck in an endless loop. Morisset has also worked with Icelandic post-rockers Sigur Ros directing that band’s concert film Inni which may be a traditional film though the methods of its creation were anything but. He shot and edited the movie in digital HD then transferred it to black-and-white film by projecting it onto a screen and recording that projection with 16mm cameras. The 16mm version of the movie was then itself projected as Morisset and his collaborators improvised manipulations using and other found objects. Then they filmed and edited that version using digital HD equipment. The result was uncanny promotional materials accurately describe it as and near-monochromatic in its tunnel visionâ€¦[inviting both intimacy and claustrophobia. We recently spoke with Morisset about the ideas behind his work collaborating with musicians and his complicated relationship with technology. interview has been edited for length and clarity.. Andy Cush Evolver.fm I wanted to start by asking you about your background especially the interactive side of your art. How did you come to work in this particular format. Vincent Morisset Director When I was younger I wanted to go into cinema so I went to school in that direction. When I was in university I was in this communication program. You had to decide whether to go into TV cinema or radio. The year I had to choose my profile they opened up this new program called multimedia and it just fit with my personality. I’m a guy who can touch every aspect of it and so I jumped in that program. This was in the late so my path kind of changed at that point. For a couple of years I’d been mainly developing graphic-based websites because at that time that was the limitation of the medium. In the beginning of the the bandwidth allowed us to play more and more with video so at that point my two loves if I may say joined back together. I started to do more and more video-based projects. I was part of a team with other people and I was the guy that was more comfortable with technology. I don’t consider myself a geek. I don’t love programming but I learned how to code in Lingo and in ActionScript to make projects happen. So I have this kind of self-taught programming background but at the same time I studied cinema. At some point those two backgrounds collided and I started doing what we now call interactive video. Evolver.fm Do you see the technology as worth pursuing on it’s own making something with the most high-tech tools available Or is it more of a means to achieve an artistic vision. Morisset I’m not a geek. I’m not really excited about the technology its own sake. I think it offers amazing possibilities but I’m not one of those guys who get excited just because of it. Ideas always drive my projects and I use the tools that are around me to achieve them. I think it’s important that we understand the possibilities and the limitations of those tools but for me it’s important that the projects are driven by ideas so that they don’t become technology demos or whatever. Evolver.fm A lot of your work though technologically impressive manages to feel very handmade and human the animations in the interactive film Bla Bla for instance or the homespun quality of this newest Arcade Fire video II\". Morisset Thanks. I think there’s a paradox about my relationship with technology. In a way I love it. One of my mottos is web is fun. I love this platform I love this medium but the way we connect with images on our laptop is really different from the way we relate to images on a TV screen. Since I want to trigger emotions through my projects I work hard so that we kind of forget that we’re in front of a computer. We forget about the technology and it just feels like a kind of weird magical thing reacting to what you do. Evolver.fm Would you talk a little bit about the II video your processes behind it and how it came to be. Morisset I’ve been working with the band forever back since Funeral so we have this ongoing creative collaboration going on. When they were recording The Suburbs\,Â I was working as artistic director on the whole visual aspect of the artwork juggling different ideas for various projects. For a while I wanted to develop an interactive video project that would be free of any interface just this thing that’s really spontaneous and primitive. I showed this really basic little demo to Regine Arcade Fire's singer/multi-instrumentalist] where you just waved your hand at the webcam and it triggered sounds and flickered the screen. She said she thought they’d have a song that was a little more pop the kind of song you could dance to and that she’d play it for me when it was done. At the end it ended up being Sprawl II. It was kind of disco-ish and for me it fit perfectly with the concept. So time passed I worked on other projects and at the end of the album cycle I was like we should really do this.. The band was totally into doing a dance-activated video but they wanted to make sure people without a webcam or a good computer would still be able to have a sense of the world we were creating so we decided to do a kind of hybrid project. We would have a traditional film that could be seen on YouTube or on TV and parallel to that would be this interactive video. That was kind of a challenge because out of the same shoot I had to do two parallel projects for two totally different mediums. Evolver.fm Thematically the album seems conflicted about the state of modern life as we know it and your video dovetails nicely with that. You created these images that at times almost feel like home video and presented them in a new confusing context. A still from Morisset's interactive video for Sprawl II. Morisset We wanted to have something that would be really simple and straightforward but not boring. So we asked ourselves what we like about music videos and decided to make something that felt spontaneous and fun with a bit of strangeness added. It’s always funny when I first show the project to different kinds of people. When they start to understand the cause and effect of their gestures and the echo in the choreography there’s this moment when they’re like They get a bit freaked out. And then when you pass this moment you kind of assimilate it and make the video your own. It’s funny how different people interact with it depending on their personality or their cultural background. Some people are more analytical about it some people just let loose. It’s funny to see how people connect with a piece like that. Evolver.fm The interactivity makes it just as much about whatever baggage you’re bringing to the table as a spectator as it is about what the artist put into it. Morisset It also connects to what the song is about. There’s this character alienated by her environment who wants to get loose and escape from that alienating environment. The fact that you dance in front of your computer is also a bit liberating and kind of weird because you’re not in a context where you normally dance. You’re at your work computer or in your living room and there’s this moment where you cross a tiny boundary. Evolver.fm One of the criticisms you often hear about internet culture is that it causes people to have short attention spans about the media they consume. Because your interactive work is mostly experienced online by its nature\,Â there’s a good chance some people won’t give it their full attention and others will perceive it as frivolous. Does that bother you at all. Morisset No not at all. I like this gray area about music video culture. There’s something really exciting about that niche because you’re juggling between two worlds. You connect to a broad audience but you’re able to propose things that are unusual and sometimes a bit challenging. It’s okay if people see it one way or another. It’s part of the process part of the game. I quite like the fact that we are able to reach all kinds of people and present it in different contexts. At some point you don’t have control over what contexts the piece will be re-presented in so you don’t know how people will look at it. And I think that’s kind of cool. Evolver.fm Yeah that must be pretty exciting. Just releasing it into the wild. Morisset You need to embrace that. It’s part of what the web is. Evolver.fm There seems to be a connection with music in a lot of your work even the stuff that isn’t commissioned by a band. When you began your career as an artist did you know that you’d have this close relationship with music Or is that something that evolved on its own. Morisset Your life is about accidents happy accidents. The fact that I started to work with Arcade Fire something like eight years ago it led me to doing projects that bounced into other projects and other projects and other people asking me to work with them. In the last years I’ve just been lucky enough to work with amazing artists. I would say it’s been this kind of theory of encounters. I didn’t look to do just music-related projects it just kind of happened like that. And I must say I decided that in the next year I’d like to explore other things.Â But I love music and I think there’s a strong connection between music and image especially for interactive stuff. When you’re playing with non-linear editing the music gives the thing a kind of emotional spine. It gives it a structure. Even if you’re playing with something that’s really reactive at least you have this backbone to keep the tension and dramatic crescendos of a piece. So it’s something really useful for me as an artist working with interactive material but I don’t way to be pigeonholed to do music stuff. Like I said before I like to touch all kinds of things. Evolver.fm Something that attracted me to Inni was the hands-on analog manipulation of the film that you guys were doing. You’re taking something that was originally filmed digitally in HD and working with it like you would with clay or paint as a physical artistic object. Could you explain that process. Morisset I see that as a traditional film. It’s linear and about an hour long but I took a lot of the expertise that I developed with web projects into that process. I’m always trying to destroy the slick perfect a bit soulless look of computer-ish imagery. In Bla Bla it was the same. I did some old school stop motion with a puppet then rotoscoped the face in 3D so that I could map the mouth and the eyes in real time. So again I was working with something that was really fragile and imperfect but using sophisticated technology along with it. With Inni it’s kind of the other way around. We took advantage of these really light-sensitive cameras and were able to edit the film in a straightforward efficient way. But there was this too-crisp feel to it it was almost like watching the news on TV. It kind of killed all the magic and the aura of what Sigur Ros is. So I thought we’d try a more spontaneous approach with the post-production. When I pitched the idea to Sigur Ros I was comparing it to when Neil Young did the Dead Man soundtrack. He sat in front of the Jim Jarmusch film with his guitar looking at it for the first time and just jammed over it. There’s this really volatile imperfect thing about it that makes it so alive and beautiful. Again computers can do amazing things but there’s something about organic handmade stuff. You can’t fake it. You just need to put your hands in the dirt and do it. Evolver.fm Tell me about your synchronized artwork for The Suburbs. Morisset Well I think there’s a lot of potential in this really straightforward way of presenting digital content synchronized with the song. It struck me that more people haven’t embraced this path. I was like I thought it was such a cool idea. Why aren’t other people doing it It’s kind of a no-brainer. It makes no sense that in 2012 we’re still stuck with a JPEG for the whole album. It’s bizarre. It’s been blocked by Apple in a way. It couldn’t be sold in their store because it’s not standard MP3s but it’s not exactly an app either. Evolver.fm It reminds me a little bit of BjÃ¶rk’s Biophilia suite of apps. Obviously they’re very different but they seem of a piece in a way because both are looking at the album format and asking could we be doing differently in 2012?. Morisset With the BjÃ¶rk thing you need to get into the app to listen to the song. You’re kind of forced to be involved in it. For me listening to music is something that can go both ways. I can remember sitting on the couch when I was younger and opening the vinyl sleeve and reading the lyrics. But when I’m on the bus I don’t want to have to hold the record sleeve. I want to put it on sleep put it in my pocket and still be able to listen to it. I still want to put it on random with other songs I still want to be able to put those tracks in a playlist. The BjÃ¶rk thing is cool in itself but I would love it if it could be embedded in your listening environment. If you’re in that you can’t do anything else. If you listen to the app album you’re in that so you have your virtual booklet open at all times. Evolver.fm Have you seen any interactive work for bands that other people are doing that inspires you. Morisset It’s not interactive but I do likeÂ Radio Soulwax. It’s a set of mixtapes with evolving artwork. Evolver.fm Is there anything happening in the world of more mainstream narrative film that’s got you excited Is that a world that you would ever consider trying to work in. Morisset I’m embracing traditional linear films. I’ve done two films so it’s not a world I’m totally unfamiliar with.Â One thing I think is exciting is how those films get around now. I think we’re on the verge of changing distribution and how we consume films so films that are a bit more niche are able to reach an audience more easily. I think Mirroir Noir the Arcade Fire documentary was one of the first feature films to be originally distributed online. When it first came out the only way you could see it was to buy it online and download the HD video.Â It was a bit peculiar no film festivals no theater screenings. At the end I think it was successful because we were able to reach in a single day the whole fan community. And people just wanted to see that film. I think if we had gone down the traditional path people would have found a torrent of it not because they wanted to pirate they just wanted to see it so badly. So in a way we short-circuited the threat and in a way that was good. After that the film got screened at some theaters and some film events. So the film’s life was inverted but in a good way.

Android devices such as these can stream to Apple AirPlay as we reported yesterday. Today Google appears to have fired back with news of a wireless music system of its own. Just yesterday we posted a widely-disseminated guide to zapping music from Android smartphones and tablets to Apple AirPlay devices. Why Because Google has been slacking on its wireless Fling technology leaving Apple to eat its wireless music lunch. As we put it yesterday should be worried. This is how people develop a taste for Apple.. We didn’t have to wait long for Google’s next move as it turned out. Today sources connected to Google told the Wall Street Journal that Google is planning some sort of amorphous wireless music system for the home after all.Â Talk about timing Between this development and Obama 2012′s Spotify playlist we’re starting to feel quite influential.. or maybe we suffer from delusions of grandeur.

The following interview with Spotify CEO Daniel Ek originally appeared on GRAMMY.com. Ek will give the keynote address at the GRAMMY Foundationâ€TMs Entertainment Law Initiative Luncheon Scholarship Presentation on Feb. 10 in Beverly Hills Calif. For more information on the GRAMMY Foundation visit www.grammyfoundation.org. The 54th Annual GRAMMY Awards airs live on Sunday Feb. 12 on CBS. Eliot Van Buskirk Evolver.fm It’s been about a year since we last met. How are things going with you lately. Daniel Ek CEO Spotify I’ve got a bit of a sore throat right now if you’re asking about me personally but Spotify is doing fantastic. That’s always great. Evolver.fm Can you give us a preview of what you intend to discuss at the GRAMMY Foundation’s Entertainment Law Initiative Luncheon. Ek There’s a lot of interesting debate going on now about streaming and I like that it’s become more about streaming and not what’s free or not. But what I really want to talk about is the future. We have this debate about where it is right now but I still think streaming is really in its infancy and I want to outline the future of what that looks like what it will actually mean for the music industry. What would it mean for how to promote an act Or for revenues. We’re at a time now when more and more people are saying actually this is working\, and we’ve got two-and-a-half million paying customers and that number is growing very very quickly and it keeps accelerating. Personally speaking I am more bullish on the future of the music industry than ever before and I think we’re kind of entering a golden age in music. Evolver.fm:Â What will that golden age look like. Spotify gets political as Barack Obama's reelection campaigners posted a Spotify playlist featuring their favorite songs including some of the president's. Ek:Â First I think we’re talking about a world where I believe most of it will be access. There will be ownership as well. I think the total amount of revenues back to the industry is going to grow. We’ve paid over $200 million to rightsholders already and it’s still in the early days. So for me part of it is talking about the growth story of how we get the music industry back to where it used to be and probably even past that. The second part is in a world where music is really about you listening to music and your friends discovering it from you what does that mean about how we break acts and promote acts Spotify up until now hasn’t really done a great job of helping that but you’re going to see us doing more and more to break acts and try to really promote them as well. Looking at Spotify today and fast-forwarding three years to 2015 Where’s the music industry Where’s Spotify and what does this mean to a band manager or label I think it’s exciting times. Creating a record is really about three core components. The first thing is creating the actual record. It used to be really expensive to do that and now really anyone can record a record even their own homes. The second piece is that it used to be really expensive distributing the record and now with iTunes Spotify and other services distributing another digital copy basically doesn’t cost anything. But the funny thing is marketing used to be kind of simple in the old days. You used to be able to just put it on the radio or MTV and it just worked. If it was a good song the record started selling based on that. Today the media landscape is much more fragmented. MTV’s not about music anymore and radio is even hard[er to break through. There are tons of radio channels and most of them play stuff people already know. So marketing an act today is really really really expensive. If it went from being a broadcast medium of just getting it out there to everyone to a social medium where music is discovered through friends what does that mean for the marketing of music I think that’s core component of getting this to work. Evolver.fm:Â That’s a really good point. I guess we’re also seeing that with some of the audio ads within Spotify which are clips of songs. Ek:Â Hopefully I’ll also be able to go into some interesting things we’ve seen my address] especially with Facebook where there are acts like Foster The People who kind of blew up on the service really because friends started discovering from other people. That’s a great story for us to show this works. People discovered it not just through radio where they didn’t have much promotion but because friends kept recommending and listening to it so their friends in turn discovered it.. Evolver.fm:Â Is that part of the decision to require a Facebook login on Spotify because you see the social sharing as so important. Ek We look at the sharing of music as really really important for our business. We’ve found that the more social our users are i.e. they’re sharing music the faster they grow their own music library. the faster they grow their music library the faster they become paying customers. That’s really the rationale for us not really the marketing side but we feel that the combination of and Spotify is a positive thing. Evolver.fm:Â I remember when we first met in New York years ago and you said that you wanted to create a legal version of the sort of experience that people have in the P2P version. My favorite thing about Napster was searching for one rare band that I loved. If someone had that then I trusted them and knew that I was going to like anything else they had. Ek:Â Yep. Evolver.fm:Â It seems like you have succeeded in translating that to a legal music service so congratulations on that. Ek:Â Yes we’ve done that. Right now it’s skewed more toward your friends. What we want to make it skew toward is you discovering other people with great music taste as well. Evolver.fm:Â Are there any misunderstandings about Spotify that you’d like to clear up. Ek:Â I feel to an extent that we’re a victim of our own success. What I mean by that is especially if you look at the media Spotify is seen as this gigantic company the size of iTunes which is not really true. We’re really starting up here and that’s how we feel about it. If you look at a country like the U.S. there’s sub-1 percent of the population that’s even using any legal streaming service. I think that sometimes people perceive us as being a lot larger than we are and that’s an important point to make. Spotify CEO Daniel Ek unveils the company's app strategy at a New York event Eliot Van Buskirk. point I want to make is that this is a very very different model than just selling a record. Everyone talks about volume and what this means in terms of numbers and I don’t think it’s comparable. In the world today there are 500 million people listening to music online. Out of them there’s only a very small portion who are avid iTunes customers which we look at today as being the majority of the digital music ecosystem. So the way we’re approaching this is we want to reach the 500 million people of whom the vast majority aren’t really using iTunes. I’d also like to address people who think they’ll gain sales by not being on Spotify. There’s not a shred of data to suggest that. In fact all the information available points to streaming services helping to drive sales. Album unit sales up in the U.S. in 2011 the year Spotify launched for the first time since 2004. More than a dozen albums which debuted at number one have been available on Spotify at launch. Spotify users are the exact same people used to listen to music every day on YouTube whose entire music collection was pulled off BitTorrent sites. By offering them a compelling music service that allows them to discover hundreds of new artists not just their favorites pulled from YouTube or we’re seeing millions move back to listening to music legally after years of being left out in the cold. They’re helping pay a ton of money back to the industry. You’re talking 10 million active users 2.5 million subscribers most of them paying $120 a year which is double the amount of your average iTunes user. Do you really want to hold back your album from people who are finally paying for music again If you think that by doing so you’re getting them to buy your album on a CD or as an album download again there’s absolutely no evidence to back that theory up. Your album’s getting shared en masse over BitTorrent over YouTube. It’s there right now but you decide that it’s the paying loyal music fans that should lose out. It makes no sense. Another thing I want to mention When someone creates a Spotify playlist and they put an album or songs in there they don’t just play them once. What actually happens is they keep repeatedly playing them. What I think is interesting and what we do here that the sales cycle of that record is anywhere from four to 12 weeks in most typical cases. With Spotify we keep seeing the effect up to 25 35 or even a year. So when looking at the effect a certain record release has one in the world of Spotify has to look not just at the first 12 weeks but actually look at six months and probably even a year after because it keeps playing. And every time someone plays a song we pay the music industry. I think that is probably the biggest misunderstanding everyone keeps comparing an apple to what’s actually not an apple but hopefully a tastier fruit. Evolver.fm:Â It seems like that would give musicians an incentive to make music that people want to listen to over and over again which could be good culturally. It’s not just about making a splash. Ek:Â Yeah At Spotify we really want you to democratically win as a musician. We want you to win because your music is the best music. And the only way you can win in the Spotify ecosystem unless you buy advertising is by friends recommending to other friends. And they do so by listening to your music. They vote with their hands and feet. I think that’s a pretty great thing for an artist that’s creating great music. What’s interesting to me looking at the greatest acts of last year is that many of those acts are acts that five or 10 years ago may not have even had a record deal but they’ve grown one of my favorite bands Mumford Sons. I don’t know how much been growing on social but I can tell you the reason why I discovered them was someone actually sent me a YouTube clip and then I started searching for them on Spotify and I discovered this fantastic band. I guess the point is that in the future we’re getting more and more connected all over the world and hopefully that will mean that great music will prevail because your friends will listen to it and share it with other friends. Spotify can send music via Apple AirPlay to home stereos and other devices. Evolver.fm:Â The two big areas for growth in digital music seem to be the car and the television. What can you tell us about Spotify’s strategy there. Ek:Â Much like we believe a strength of the CD being ubiquitous that you can take a CD and put it in any player and just press play that’s how easy we want it to be to play music with Spotify. As more and more devices are getting connected the base of people who will want to listen to music with those devices will increase and that’s something we’re hugely excited Evolver.fm:Â To switch gears for a second I was very interested to cover what Spotify is doing with apps. You can build desktop apps on Spotify’s catalog iOS apps and now you can build apps within the Spotify desktop client. How significant do you see that ecosystem Is it going to be a major part of Spotify’s growth in the future. Ek:Â Yeah we definitely do believe that. There are multiple ways one can look at this but what we’re trying to primarily address is that when it comes to music we’ve got 15 or 16 million tracks. I don’t even know what the exact number is but there’s an endless amount of music. You could listen your whole life to the Spotify catalog and you probably wouldn’t get through a third of it. What’s needed on top of that is curated experiences. Part of that curated experience is people building playlists and sharing those playlists with their friends. But another part is trusted sources people who tend to be really really good at music. There are things you can with music that aren’t Spotify’s core like lyrics ticketing and other things. We felt that the Internet really was silent and that music was missing. We wanted to create a platform to allow people to interact with music whether that’s providing curation or providing more interesting experiences or even using that to give you other venues such as ticketing and merchandising. We think all of those things are super exciting but they’re not our core competency. We might have 100 or 150 engineers and that’s great but already now with the Spotify platform we’ve got thousands of engineers working on creating more interesting music experiences. And that’s ultimately really good for the music industry because there are more avenues now to listen to music and interact with music. Ultimately that’s going to make more people care about music and pay for it again. Spotify runs on the iPad and many other devices courtesy of Flickr/Andreas Blixt. Evolver.fm:Â We’ve talked a little bit about the royalty payouts. Some people have said from time to time that the payouts are too low and others point out that with hundreds of millions of dollars changing hands how can that be low A few artists are deciding not to have releases on Spotify so I guess one conclusion to draw would be that it’s too difficult to do freemium streaming to pay what seem like very high royalties in one sense but on a per-artist level some people say it’s not very much. How do you see this playing out. Ek:Â As I said a lot of people try to compare an apple to another fruit and as I started out saying we look at it as us being in our infancy. We haven’t even started really. We’re still a really young company. So ultimately our view is that the royalty checks we’re paying out now of course we’re happy that there’s progress being made but it’s still only in its early days and it will keep growing. Last year was a great testament to that in May we hit a million paying customers and at the end of that year we were at two-and-a-half million. That’s a significant increase in customers who are paying 100 bucks a year. And Spotify keeps growing at that pace if not faster. So I think the royalty checks as they’re combined will definitely grow. But I also want to kind of caution people. We get a lot of media attention. People think we’re actively seeking that media attention and in most instances we’re not. People just like the product so much that they like to write about it. I find this when I meet artists. They actually think we’re a lot larger than we are. I say we’re not really. We’re roughly 10 million users in countries where in total there are 600 million people. And out of them at least 250 million are listening to music online so we’re actually a very small part of this right now.. I want to add that my home country Sweden where Spotify has grown to scale if you look at the artists now the vast majority of the artists are getting between 50 and 60 percent of all their income from Spotify. And I think that’s what’s going to happen when this model gets to scale. And the music industry Sweden is growing. Evolver.fm:Â The latest thing with Spotify and Facebook is this ability to listen to the same thing at the same time which I think is a fantastic feature. It makes music not only something between a person an MP3 player and a pair of headphones. Over the long term is this going to become a mainstream activity or is it just for people like me who use the latest stuff and get a kick out of it. Ek:Â Our approach is that we don’t know. With that said we think music is the most social thing there is and we think people want to interact with music. The background on that feature is that it was actually built by Facebook which we think is cool. One of the engineers there showed it to me one time when I came to visit and he was like do you think about this?. I said is awesome you should just release it.. The coolest thing is that he could build that feature because Spotify is a platform so he could interact with our APIs create it and put it on the service. We didn’t actually interact that much to get this done but it was one of the things that the Facebook folks were really passionate about and I think I hope and I believe that there will be 10 other projects similar to this around the Web right now where people build cool interesting experiences. Two weeks ago someone created the Spotify app Soundrop released their own iOS app. So now all of a sudden I have a room where I’m walking around and people talk about music where they vote for which track will come next. It’s kind of a social radio. And that was built by two guys in Oslo. I guess the answer is that we don’t know what will work or not but we’re thrilled that people want to innovate around it. Evolver.fm:Â So do you still find time to play guitar. Ek:Â I do I actually bought a travel guitar and that guitar is really cool. You can actually fold the guitar and you can plug headphones into it but it’s acoustic or semi-acoustic. So I do more actually than I did last year.

Participants at Boston Music Hack Day 2010 will converge to create operational music technologies over a single weekend. of last year's event Rich Orris. Hundreds of music technologists will enter Boston Music Hack Day this weekend and.. okay hundreds of technologists will leave too. Before they do theyâ€TMll spend an action-packed weekend at Microsoftâ€TMs aptly-named New England Research and Development Center inventing building and presenting music apps hardware hacks and art projects.Â The official rules are simple. software hardware art the web. Anything goes as long as it’s music related.. Mere mortals such as myself are often shocked by the pace of innovation these days which is mostly due to the dedication ingenuity and yes occasionally genius of the coders and makers who build the technology we use every day. Music is no exception. At Boston Music Hack Day on October 16th and 17th you can literally see this innovation happen either in person or through a live video stream. There’s even a T-shirt courtesy of a crowdsourced design challenge. So what will you see Lots of smart people building the next generation of smart music applications everything from powerful listening tools you might use every day to completely whimsical creations like The Swinger created at San Francisco’s Music Hack Day which famously enforced a swing beat on hits like Guns N Roses Child O Mine noted by Boing Boing and others). Music Hack Days where technology enthusiasts gather to build both serious creations and off-the-wall apps like The Swinger have sprung up in many of the world’s tech hotspots since the first event was held in London last July. The previous Boston Music Hack Day drew over 350 software wizards hardware tinkerers and members of the press eager to witness the creation of new technologies. Designer Jocelyn Petko of Alburtis Pennsylvania won the 24-hour-long contest to design the T-shirt for Boston Music Hack Day with this design. On Saturday and Sunday participants will build their ideas with each team presenting their creations on Sunday evening in the hopes of winning a variety of prizes. Sponsors of the event include Collecta extensions.fm Microsoft NERD MTV Mozilla MusiXMatch SonicBids SoundCloud TicketFly and The Echo Nest which publishes Evolver.fm. more about the relationship between Evolver.fm and The Echo Nest.. We’re currently witnessing the dawn of another digital music revolution as the media player migrates from hardware to software more specifically to web and mobile apps that apply powerful data APIs to innovative ideas that would never be feasible on a pure hardware level. Hardware interfaces continue to be important but because MP3 players can be code now they have the potential to do a lot more than they could just a few years ago. I was there when Steve Jobs announced the iPod but these days even Steve Jobs knows apps are where the action is. Iâ€TMm not the only one looking forward to seeing this yearâ€TMs creations in all their forms. Hereâ€TMs that livestream link again and to whet your appetite some more photos from last yearâ€TMs event. Stay tuned throughout the weekend for more Boston Music Hack Day coverage following that we will return to our regularly nonscheduled programming. Events News. boston music hack day hackday mhd.

Curious which Oscar-nominated animated short film will win the Academy Award on February 26 Well I'm no prognosticator and I honestly don't really care which little-known filmmaker takes home the golden statue. But I am happy the Oscars exist and have the animated short category because it means that moviegoers have at least one chance a year to see at least five exceptional animated shorts in the theater. There's usually at least one in the bunch I'm not that in love with but even 4 out of 5 makes for a great program especially when the best films are really something special. And maybe you like the Academy will enjoy them all. year's Oscar-nominated shorts will be released to theaters this Friday February 10. I've seen all five of the animated shorts and have ranked them in order of my favor below with review and preview notes. 1. Luna. know it’s somewhat obvious and boring to name a Pixar short as the best but I’m no constant Pixar champion. I do think they produce some really weak ones including those that get nominated for example) and anyway they don’t win all the time. In fact they haven’t won the Oscar in this category in a decade. Last year they did actually deserve it with the clever 3D piece Night and now they deserve it again with this 7-minute Italo Calvino-inspired short written and directed by Enrico Casarosa previously a story artist on and and head of story on an upcoming Pixar feature. what makes the short so wonderful It’s the most basic timeless and magical kind of storytelling and cinematographically with its blend of computer animation and watercolor/pastel backdrops it’s the one short among these nominees that I wish I’d seen on the big screen still can I suppose. It features three generations of males in a family of moon sweepers. I guess I shouldn’t give away entirely what that entails but it involves a fresh yet familiar kind of myth about the moon something that could be as lasting at least for the sake of children’s wonder as the lunar deities and the Man in the Moon. With its kinship to Georges Melies Trip to the Moon\, I think this is to what the next film is to Artist that means the next film will actually win?. the trailer 2. Fantastic Flying Books of Mr. Morris Lessmore. somewhat with the theme of celebrating old movies this hybrid of miniatures computer animation and 2D animation fits well in this year’s Academy Awards roster. The 15-minute work begins in New Orleans as a Katrina-like storm busts through the French Quarter while the title character a bit of a mash-up between Buster Keaton and Charlie Chaplin’s tramp is reading a book. Even the words are blown off the pages and eventually an obvious of Oz allusion brings Mr. Morris Lessmore through the air and then grounds him in a now-black-and-white disaster area. But soon the playful Katrina stuff is gone as the man comes across a house filled with flying clapping piano-playing life-giving books of all shapes and sizes. Think of it somewhere between the extremes of Disney’s in Wonderland and Pagemaster with a touch of thrown in. I appreciate its ability to tell a story without dialogue I think it helps too much that the story here has little sense or reason behind it. And is it saying that literature will fix all of the Big Easy’s problems This short does look great however and you can tell this film is written and directed by a veteran author of children’s books and producer of animated features such as Louisiana’s own William Joyce who has worked for Pixar Disney Fox Animation and now an upcoming feature adaptation of his series of Childhood” DreamWorks Animation. Co-directed by Brandon Oldenburg a conceptual artist who previously worked with Joyce on in full 3. Morning Stroll. the streak of relatively dialogue-free shorts with homage to old cinema this is an amusing cartoon inspired by a very short story by Linda Elegant titled Chicken\, which is allegedly real and therefore included in Paul Auster’s Tales of American Life posted in full here. The original tale simply involves the sighting of a chicken on what seemed to be an independent morning stroll down the street and up to its residence where the bird knocked on the door and was subsequently let inside. only 7 minutes Grant Orchard to Glaringly\, which you can watch here expands on the surreal idea with three separate reenactments in three different time periods each rendered in a corresponding animation style. The end of the third bit provides a kind of punchline for the whole thing after climaxing with a post-apocalyptic zombie attack. The first act is the classic cinema tribute in that it’s very simple animation presented as if projected with old-timey flicker. I’d love to see the rest of Auster’s crowd-sourced collection adapted with such fun and inventive bits. the trailer 4. Life. sure I should like this one a bit more than I do. And I actually do think it’s quite good but it’s directed by Amanda Forbis and Wendy Tilby who really captivated us with their 1999 Oscar nominee\,“When the Day Breaks that one here. Tilby also was nominated in 1992 for which I also find stylishly superior that one here. I figure this sleepy somber western tale of an Englishman trying to make it in the Wild West of Alberta in 1909 as an analogical comet flies by overhead assume it’s meant to be Halley’s) is not really worthy of being the work that finally gets the filmmakers their Academy Award unless it’s really for career achievement purposes. the trailer 5. least favorite of the five is this crudely drawn and slightly morbid tale of a little Canadian boy’s Sunday which consists of church company and coins the last of which he flattens on the railroad tracks. Also squashed is a dog run-over by his family car and what appears to be part of his imagination. I lost interest in the story and the skewed traditional animation quite early in the 9-minute short which was directed by Patrick Doyon and I was disappointed that it didn’t at least have a cheap gag thrown in at the end. I’m just as upset that I would even wish for such a thing. the trailer Follow Christopher Campbell on Twitter Spout on Twitter More Shorts Short Film Awards Oscars Academy Awards Pixar Animation Reviews Reviews Reply Stephen Tue Feb 07 16:26:15 EST 2012Reply Thanks for the reviews and the links A local art institute in my midwest city is playing all the nominated shorts the docs unfortunately and I'm excited to see them all on the big screen.

Email Updates. Monthly Archives. Most Around The Network. the network. indiewire. categories. Never exactly the finest hour of the Oscars the Best Original Song category of the Academy Awards this year has been something of a fiasco. First it was nominations with only two tracks - or Muppet from Muppets and In Rio from the animated film - making the cut. Then at the start of this week Deadline broke the news that neither song would be performed as part of the Oscar telecast seemingly in the ever-vain hope of keeping the running time of the ceremony under three hours despite protestations from those behind the two films and many others. category has always been a somewhat extraneous side-bar but at its best Björk for in the Dark\, Robin Williams leading high-kicking mounties in a rendition of Canada\, or Glen Hansard and Marketa Inglova performing and winning for Slowly from it can provide some of the biggest talking points of the night. The move not to honor the nominees this year isn't unprecedented were also skipped two years ago) but it seems to signify a lack of confidence in the category from the Academy and a possible signifier that its place may not be long for this world. It's principally the fault of the music branch's new voting system. The short version of the process is that a song from a film has to score an average of over 8.25 to become a nominee although if no contenders make that mark the two highest will be picked which may well have been the case this year. It's the worst possible system and will hopefully be scrapped in future years. assuming the branch got their shit together were there any worthier nominees than the two rather mediocre ones they picked Well yes in fact. Below we've picked out five original songs that deserved a place on the list on merit alone and that could have livened up the Academy Awards broadcast to no end. We've kept ourselves to eligible songs - written specifically for the film and featuring in the body of the movie or as the first song in the end credits - but still found plenty that were worthier than In Rio. Listen to our picks below. A Happy Song Jason Segel Amy Adams Walter Feist Mickey Rooney Muppets\" Muppets\, the closest thing to an original live-action musical we've had in some time was always going to get one nomination it's a testament to the songwriter's branch that they somehow managed to nominate the least engaging song of the film. Or Muppet is sort of fun but how do you resist the upbeat catchy charms of A Happy Song\, the Bret McKenzie-penned opening number that wasn't just the highlight of the soundtrack but also the whole film It's an earworm it's got big laughs puppets a solo showcase for A-lister Amy Adams and even the opportunity to get 91-year-old veteran Mickey Rooney on the stage for his one-line cameo. Not nominating this one suggests that even the songwriters branch don't care about the category anymore. Tonight Alex Turner least for this one the actual voters can't be blamed for whatever reason the film's less than stellar box office performance) The Weinstein Company seemingly chose not to submit any of Arctic Monkeys frontman Alex Turner's six original compositions that make up the soundtrack to Richard Ayoade's charming debut for consideration. It's an awful shame as no picture this year so closely interweaved its song-score with the film which is meant to be the point of the category. Turner who's still a mere 26 is one of the most gifted songwriters of his generation melding melody with incisive witty lyrics and the swooning Tonight is the highlight of his work on although really any of the tunes could have made the cut. You Can Wait The National ft. Sharon Van Etten Win\" one caused a little internal debate but even The Playlist's head honchos who are less enamored of The National's brand of muscular Springsteen-indebted rock than this writer had to admit that their contribution to Tom McCarthy's Win was more deserving of a nomination than 95 of the field. A trademark ballad of male inadequacy and self-destruction featuring backing vocals by Brooklyn singer-songwriter Sharon Van Etten it's a beautiful little number and given how huge the band have gotten these days could have made for a performance that helped bring in new viewers to the telecast. Maybe it was the placement of the film's end credits that did it in but alas we'll never know. Theme The Chemical Brothers ft. Stephanie Dosen one never submitted for consideration this is the sole vocal track from Chemical Brothers score for Joe Wright's pop-art actioner Featuring haunting vocals from singer-songwriter and occasional Massive Attack member Stephanie Dosen it's a neat crystalization of the childlike fairy-tale feel of both the film. But if you're looking to get on the dancefllor the score isn't afraid to unleash some block-rocking beats when needed. There's basically no precedent for something of this sort being nominated and performed at the show but you can't say it wouldn't have livened things up and it certainly deserves it on merit. the video below is not official but the only embed we could find that wouldn't make you jump to YouTube to hear it. Ben Nichols Shelter\" so Shelter isn't exactly the kind of movie that the Best Original Song category usually features and neither is the theme tune by Ben Nichols frontman of Memphis band Lucero. But then it's only two years since Weary Kind from Heart won the Oscar and last year saw Strong from Strong nominated so it's not inconceivable for something like this to be featured and Nichols acoustic country-tinged ballad is a far more robust song than most of the nominations and certainly more interesting than those from bigger stars like Mary J. Blige and Chris Cornell. Plus with Michael Shannon missing out on an actor nomination it would have been a nice bit of exposure for a film that needed more. Also Worthy Spangled Man from America The First Avenger comes from multiple nominee Alan Menken and would have made a pretty impressive production number while Zaz's Valant from was a pretty little French tune that could have brought a little international flavor. Meanwhile Elvis Costello She Him and Jónsi also had songs respectively Day\, The Pooh and Bought a Zoo\" that while far from their best work are more deserving than In Rio. Speaking of if they were going to nominate a song from why not highlight Bird\, a genuinely funny showcase for the film's villain Nigel voiced by Jemaine Clement Which if nothing else would have made the category a showdown between the two members of Flight of the Conchords. Finally if Three Six Mafia can win for Hard Out There For A Pimp\, why not That Snitch from the Block?. More Oscars Academy Awards Submarine Alex Turner Win Win The National The Muppets The Chemical Brothers Hanna Take Shelter Reply Rik Thu Feb 09 18:07:40 EST 2012Reply You have to have a heart of iron not to love Zaz's Valant from My selection for the year's best. At least the score is nominated. andrea Thu Feb 09 15:24:34 EST 2012Reply it's a scandal the 2 songs nominated this year on the Oscars...Madonna with her Masterpiece from W.E. would deserve the nomination epecially after winning the Golden Globe. iche Thu Feb 09 08:41:33 EST 2012Reply god you guys are so white. ben Wed Feb 08 18:02:59 EST 2012Reply I think you might be confusing the National with the Hold Steady. rodie Wed Feb 08 16:44:30 EST 2012Reply The entire Submarine EP from Alex Turner is really gorgeous singing and songwriting. I love it. Cinematic_high Wed Feb 08 16:38:25 EST 2012Reply Alex Turner's Hard To Get Around The Wind should of been nominated. It's not only the best song on the entire soundtrack but it's one of the best songs he's ever written in his career so far I do agree with you on A Happy Song\"....that snub pissed me off You seriously need to give The National a serious listen because the silly comparison you made is inaccurate as fuck Why don't we just call Bruno Mars a modern day Marvin Gaye while we're at it. Oogle monster Wed Feb 08 16:24:02 EST 2012Reply Life's A Happy Song is by far the best song in The Muppets. Man or Muppet is catchy and unique but I couldn't get the former out of my head for WEEKS. cirkusfolk Wed Feb 08 15:36:02 EST 2012Reply Love The National but anyone else hear shades of Berlin's Take My Breath Away in there song Now there is a great song from a movie. anonymouse Wed Feb 08 14:17:32 EST 2012Reply the national's springsteen influenced muscular rock WTF?. have you ever heard any of their albums this has to be the weirdest description of them i have ever read. they're a bit more nuanced adult indie than muscle rock. good list tho. Wed Feb 08 13:48:17 EST 2012Reply Brap brap brap. Nik Grape Wed Feb 08 13:36:31 EST 2012Reply To be honest the Best Song category was always the least one I cared about and more often than not the songs nominated were a drag to sit through for the song from Once which was a delight. If they got rid of this category all together I wouldn't mind it a bit... leaves more room for funny skits. Let the Grammys have the songs I say. Benjamin Wed Feb 08 13:18:53 EST 2012Reply I would love to see Ben Nichols fall of the stage of the Kodak Theatre drunk. Jacob Thu Feb 09 14:36:07 EST 2012. So much this. The Oscars need a little more drunken rowdy fun IMO. Get the latest headlines from The Playlist delivered to your inbox every day.

Dawn Part 1 Summit Keep hope alive Bella and RPatz fans and start getting that petition together for Stephenie Meyer Ever since Lionsgate swooped in a bought Summit the biggest question has been what their plans are for the latter's biggest franchise and most valuable asset - the films. Last month Lionsgate chief Jon Feltheimer said I hope so\, when asked if the lucrative series would continue past the final film Dawn Part 2 when it arrives this fall. And it might. motion picture group co-chair Rob Friedman was asked by THR about the possibility of a 6th film and he said if the material is there in another book it will happen. she wishes to do it we’ll be there to support her\, he said. Messageboards all over the world are now in meltdown. really there is probably no doubt that Lionsgate wants to find a way to keep the money for Summit's biggest cashcow flowing. To date the series has raked in over $1 billion worldwide at the box office that's not counting merchandise books and other ephemera. And the studio is estimating that the finale Dawn 2 will add $700 million to the bank ambitious overestimate considering it would have to do 150 more business than Dawn Part 1'. But either way Lionsgate has dollar signs in their eyes and we wouldn't be surprised if they've already put feelers out to Meyer to see what her feelings are about returning to Forks Washington. Twihards say a prayer under your Edward or Jacob poster tonight. The story may not be over yet.

Financial success doesnâ€TMt just happen you have to plan for it. A spending plan can help you allocate your money resources to the financial goals that will provide you with a secure future as well as help you enjoy your life right now. When your family creates a spending plan you take control of your financial destiny and play an active role in what happens to your family next. Deciding on your values priorities and goals. The first thing to determine is what your shared values priorities and goals are as a family. Your spending plan should help you to live the life you want not to be a carbon copy of some other familyâ€TMs life and priorities. Talk about what you value as a family. This could be spending time together at home going on the occasional vacation giving to charity performing service supporting extracurricular activities or buying a new big-screen TV. Realize that there are no wrong answers. Decide what defines you as a family and set goals together. Then decide which goals should take priority. If your family wants to become obligation-free then a plan to pay off debt should be the number-one priority. If you want to save up for a down payment on a house set a timeframe and put your savings toward that goal. Allocating your financial resources. Once you understand your familyâ€TMs goals itâ€TMs time to figure out how to allocate your resources. Of course you will first need to cover expenses like housing payments groceries clothing utilities and insurance. Then look at how much each month can realistically go toward helping your family accomplish its goals. Prioritize your savings so you will be able to achieve your short-term and long-term goals. While you might want to start saving for retirement your bigger priority might be paying down debt. Put more of your resources toward debt reduction for now but donâ€TMt neglect the long-term goal of retirement savings. As you get rid of debt you can shift your money toward funding retirement. Prioritize your spending so that the most important items are paid for first. Knowing your priorities ahead of time makes it less painful to make budget cuts because you can start by cutting the items off the bottom of your list. For example your family might be saving money for a vacation. You determine that $150 a month needs to be set aside for the next 10 months but you might not have enough money to do everything else you want. You might need to drop off some of the less important expenses such as going to the movies or buying a new iPad. Earning more. Your spending plan doesnâ€TMt just have to be about figuring out where to cut back on spending. Involve every member of the family in discussing what can be done to contribute to the accomplishment of family goals whether itâ€TMs cutting back on less-important spending or doing odd jobs to help boost the family income. Mark your progress toward your goals and find ways to celebrate as you accomplish your objectives. And as you achieve your current goals remember to adjust your spending plan so that your newly freed financial resources can shift to fund the next adventure.

When I write about family finance I.. My name is Miranda Marquit and Iâ€TMm a personal finance advice blogger. I have a passion for financeâ€”especially as it relates to helping ordinary families build wealth and direct their resources according to their own values and priorities. When I write about family finance I like to focus on the ways you can use your financial resources to build the life you want for your family. For the most part I believe that focusing on improving your ability to earn money as well as making spending choices that reflect your own goals can do this. While I believe that saving money is important and that you should get the best value for your dollar I donâ€TMt often write about pinching pennies. Iâ€TMm more about looking for ways to create the lifestyle you want by identifying your values and priorities and then allocating your money in a way that reflects whatâ€TMs most important to you. Identifying your goals and looking to the future. Whether your goals are to build a retirement nest egg create passive income dig out of a debt hole pay for your children to attend college save for a down payment on a new home create a fully funded emergency account or travel the world only you can determine the life you want to live. There are strategies you can follow to ensure that you can afford the things that are most important to you at each of your familyâ€TMs milestones. This type of planning requires a long-term view as well as the ability to honestly evaluate your current situation and identify your goals. I hope my posts will inspire you to create your own financial road map based on your familyâ€TMs values. My posts will include some of the actions my family is taking right now as well as actions we hope to take in the future. Additionally I will look at how your family relationships can affect the way you interact with money and how you set priorities as a familyâ€”especially if you sometimes want different things or have different approaches to money. Why should you read what I have to say. Iâ€TMve made my share of mistakes in life when it comes to finances. I dug out from credit card debt amassed at college and Iâ€TMm still recovering in some ways from earlier financial missteps. However 10 years after my marriage started with debt I have a M.A. in journalism from Syracuse University my husband has completed his Ph.D. and my family is able to meet all of our needs and most of our wants. Iâ€TMve learned tough financial lessons through experience. On top of that Iâ€TMve had the opportunity to research different financial and investing strategies as part of my career as a finance writer. I write for a variety of financial websites on subjects ranging from investing to business to personal and family finance. My work has appeared in been mentioned by and linked from major news websites including The New York Times The Washington Post USA Today The Consumerist The Atlantic Wire and The Huffington Post. I am lucky to work from home doing something I love and Iâ€TMm excited to work with Equifax to help you find ways your family can work toward financial freedom.

Looking for a hot new car You better start thinking about saving money on your next auto insurance policy. The annual Auto Show is coming to Chicago this weekend as it begins to make the rounds nationally and car manufacturers will be offering deals to tempt you into buying the newest model. According to the National Automotive Dealers Association new cars are now selling at the highest prices in years as demand improves. Higher prices mean you might have to think carefully about what options and features will fit into your budget. If youâ€TMre looking at luxury models be prepared for insurance sticker price shock. Some luxury cars will hike your auto insurance premium. However other luxury cars are much cheaper to insure. If youâ€TMre looking to buy a new car saving money on your auto insurance premium should be a factor in your decision. For families the Toyota Sienna LE minivan is a steal as the least expensive 2012 model vehicle for auto insurance according to Insure.com. have always had a strong showing in our expensiveâ€TM rankings\,â said Amy Danise of Insure.com. regularly prove to be safe economical vehicles.â. Toyota takes the top two spots for least expensive cars to insure with the Sienna LE and the Sienna 4 cyl. Jeep takes the next two spots with the Patriot Sport and the Jeep Compass Sport. If youâ€TMre looking for a pickup truck your wallet is safe. The GMC Sierra K1500 Regular Cab takes the fifth spot for least expensive vehicle to insure. If youâ€TMre looking for something a bit sportier itâ€TMs going to cost you. The 2012 Audi Spyder Quattro a two-set V10 convertible is the most expensive car to insure this year. Audi Mercedes and Porsche take the top five slots for most expensive cars to insure. The flash factor isnâ€TMt the only criteria when insurance companies are looking at your car. Underwriters take into consideration the frequency of crashes for that model the cost of repairs the cost to insurers when a vehicle is declared a total loss and the cost of bodily injury claims. The make and model can push an auto insurance quote higher or lower but there are things you can do save money on your auto insurance premiums. Install Safety Features. If safety features arenâ€TMt included in the basic model shell out the extra cash to have safety features installed. Youâ€TMll be more secure on the road and some insurance companies give discounts for safety-related items like air bags anti-lock brakes and anti-theft devices. Raise Your Deductible. Consider raising the deductible on new cars on your auto insurance policy. If youâ€TMre willing to pay more out of pocket to repair a new car youâ€TMll save more money. When your cars are a few years old you can reduce the coverage. These cars have a lower market value and any money you get from a claim probably wonâ€TMt be more than the cost of the insurance and deductible. Bundle Insurance Policies. Insurance companies want all of your business. Ask your insurance agent what kind of discount is available if you bundle your homeowners and auto insurance plans. Are you renting You can usually save money on your auto insurance if you bundle your policy with a renterâ€TMs policy. As youâ€TMre shopping for a new car keep your auto insurance premiums in mind. A smart decision on the car lot can save you hundreds of dollars over the lifetime of your car. Ilyce R.

Professional Accounting Software. Payroll Solutions. ProSeries Tax Solutions Lacerte Tax Solutions More Products Solutions. Additional Resources. Training Resources. Featured Products Solutions. A sales tax is an excise tax on transactions. Traditionally the types of transactions where a state could demand sales tax collection were easy to identify. Typical transactions in the last century were remarkably localized compared to modern commercial channels. Cross-border transactions were the exception. Today cross-border transactions are theÂ norm. Vendors of all sizes and all niches are likely to engage in business transactions with parties all over the United States and perhaps the world. The elimination of borders as a barrier to trade places particular emphasis on the essential question vendors are compelled to collect sales taxes?â. In this arena one very important legal principle always takes center stage nexus. In the legal sense nexus describes the connection between two or more participants interests or concepts. In the world of sales tax nexus refers to the connection a retailer has with a state. Nexus is the legal connection that empowers a state to demand collection and remittance of a retail sales tax. The U.S. Supreme Court developed its core concept of nexus in the field of taxation more than 125 years ago. power of taxation however vast in its character and searching in its extent is necessarily limited to subjects within the jurisdiction of the State. These subjects are persons property and business. Whatever form taxation may assume whether as duties imports excises or licenses it must relate to one of these subjects.â€Â Cleveland v Penn.Â 82 US 179 186 More recently the Court gave us one deceptively simple lineâ nexus rule in 1992. a seller whose only connection with customers in the State is by common carrier or the United States mailâ lack(s the requisite minimum contacts with the Stateâ€Â Quill v N.D. 112 S. Ct. 1904 This lineâ rule for sales tax nexus is presented in theÂ negative. TheÂ QuillÂ rule instructs a vendor whatÂ is notÂ nexus but it leaves a vendor empty-handed if it is looking for exactly whatÂ isÂ nexus constitutionally speaking of course. The Court has its own reasons for avoiding specifics in this area because it believes the rules of sales tax collection between the states falls confidently on the U.S. Congress to figure out. Where does this leave us Since states are eager to require collection and remittance many have taken steps to expand their definition of nexus by regulatory and policy efforts. However the limited utility of theÂ QuillÂ decision left them plenty of room for creativity. A Few of the Ways States Try to Compel Collection and Remittance. Recently states have developed and tested legal theories in order to push the boundaries of nexus. Some have met with success and some have not most disconcerting however is that some theories are still being vetted in state and federal courthouses. Attributional Affiliate Nexus Laws):Â The expansion of the affiliate concept is currently being pushed by a few states. New York has had success defending its so-called Lawâ with the following affiliate definition of nexus. an affiliated person that is a vendor as otherwise defined in this paragraph uses in the state trademarks service marks or trade names that are the same as those the seller uses or an affiliated person engages in activities in the state that inure to the benefit of the seller in its development or maintenance of a market for its goods or services in the stateâ N.Y. Tax Law 1101(b)(8)(i)(I. These laws are directed at Internet-based vendors who use advertisements.â The ads appear on web pages based on servers in New York State. Under these circumstances the court stated Amazonâ€TMs lack of control over the web page owners did not preclude the state from enforcing collection on the Internet vendor. The lawâ opens the door for states to require sales tax collection in situations where a company has only limited commercial activities within a state. As Internet marketing becomes more complex and entangled there are more opportunities for otherwise remote activities to trigger sales tax nexus in a given state. In-State Representatives It seems intuitive that paid representatives in a state will trigger nexus. However the use ofÂ independentcontractors and sales representatives performing significant activities in a state has generally been held to create nexus. An independent representative need not even be paid in some states in order to trigger nexus. Occasional or Minimum Presence In general permanence is not a required element for the nexus analysis. In fact many courts find nexus either through existence of property or agents of the vendor. For example the N.Y. Court of Appeals declared that while a physical presence of the vendor is required it need not be substantial. Rather it must be demonstrably more than a presence.â€Â Vermont Info ProcessingÂ 86 NYS 2d 165 Otherwise innocuous instances of a vendorâ€TMs presence such as deliveries installation or occasional service calls can trigger nexus. Transactional Nexus Any office in a state can trigger nexus. Even sales entirely unrelated to the inâ€“state presence of a vendorâ€TMs employees are subject to sales tax collection. For example a mail order company with an advertising office in-state even where that office is entirely unrelated to the mail order business is still required to collect on mail order sales. If your clients have business in more than one state nexus laws affect them. Donâ€TMt be caught unaware Keep up with sales tax laws so your clients can rest easy. Shane Ratigan.

How disgusting But honey badger don't care. to work on this a little longer it was mentioned that it looked a bit rushed hopefully I remedied that issue send message. love it!!. I especially like the silhouette of hogwarts in the background GMV. send message. This version does look so much more you send message. What does this have to do with the topic. send message. Honey badger doesn't belong at Hogwarts and shouldn't be eating the other mascots. Honey badger isn't like the other animals. But honey badger don't care. send message. That's just silly.. I mean in a good way of course. Some of your designs recently have a different line quality about them as though they're hand drawn rather than vector-drawn. Have you been doing something different or is it my imagination on second thought your other designs don't look vector-ish.. I dunno but something looks different.. send message. This is entertaining. But the bird should be an eagle. send message. Well I guess it could be one actually. send message. Too many colors... It's really hard to tell here which is a color and which is halftones which also makes me question the fineness of the halftones for display purposes. send message. All the halftones are one standard size display it in the detail closeup in the top corner halftones are used for shading on the badger and scarves lion's mane and the snake's body. I have used this technique on many of my designs in the past the nice thing about it is that it prints in a way that it is almost indistinguishable from simply using extra colors. It works really well because the halftones are of of a consistent size rather than being set up as a gradient which makes it much cleaner for printing since they don't fade out to an infinitely small size but rather are uniform send message. hahaha I love this. send message. o.. maybe that's why it looks different or I am crazy. Either way that sounds like a good way to halftone I'll have to look up how to do it since I am photoshop newb. send message. Hmm interesting sounding. I would be interested in seeing some close-ups of the various multi-colored areas. I've been trying to watch the various ways halftoning has been done around here lately and this method makes for a strong difference for the shrunken preview image in a way that makes it more impressive than some forms of halftone shrinking. Do you apply them at any particular or varied angle And do you use the same angle for different patches of the same color or different angles for different colors etc send message. This shirt has no connection to the topic at all. A badger is one of the four mascots of the Hogwarts houses. The fact that it's eating the snake is weird - it makes no sense at all - but that doesn't put it on topic. send message. I always apply them at the same angle degrees) for backgrounds and solid colored areas I use a round halftone and for shading I use a line halftone. I find that keeping it uniform makes things look a lot cleaner in general. Here are some closeups so you can see how it works The nice thing about it is that when printed it doesn't look like dots or lines but sort of to some degree with the color underneath to create a really convincing shading effect where the halftone is almost imperceptible I went back through the show us your woot thread to see if there were any photos from other times I used this technique. The best example I could find there was from my school design where I used this to shade all the turtle shells the colors are a little bright from the flash in this photo but you can clearly see how the shading comes out really smooth looking as though another color were used. Line halftones especially when properly placed can really play tricks on your eyes and create great shading effects without getting excessively small. send message. Thanks for the explanation super helpful. send message. NP when I first started I had no idea what halftones even were. In one of my earlier designs I actually drew in diamonds by hand to create a halftone-like effect because I had no idea how people were creating them. One of the artists on the site at the time graciously explained to me how to do it after that point so I'm glad to be able to help people with it now that I've been doing it for more than 3 years and have a lot more practice send message. Thank you very much actually for taking the time to type up a reply. I actually notice in the school one you use the varied-size halftoning for the background which is what I've been used to seeing until recently. That's why I was curious about this particular technique. And yeah even printed like that the back-shading for the turtles does look like a completely separate color in that photo. Neat. send message. Sure it does The badger which is usually known for their gentle/good-natured side is killing the snake It also references to Honey badgers which is just awesome send message. its connection to the theme is the actual animal the honey badger an aggressive animal that eats other predators like venomous snakes unlike other animals that just hunt things that don't bite back. i'm assuming the hogwarts theme was just added to give it more entertainment value since both the badger and snake happen to be hogwarts mascots. send message. Thank you very much for the information on how you do your halftones. For me it has been one of the hardest things to learn how to make look good at all. If you don't mind in this entry what is the LPI on the shading Thanks again Firefrogh send message. Something that you like doesn't make this on topic. As to your first argument that's not Out of Water or something that doesn't belong. It's something acting outside of its normal. Not the same thing. And we have no way of knowing that this is the honey badger don't care meme since it's a Harry Potter reference. And let's say that it is that meme it makes even less sense. leevijeans wrote:its connection to the theme is the actual animal the honey badger an aggressive animal that eats other predators like venomous snakes unlike other animals that just hunt things that don't bite back. i'm assuming the hogwarts theme was just added to give it more entertainment value since both the badger and snake happen to be hogwarts mascots. The shirt is a Harry Potter shirt so all four of them belong. Not one of them is the fish out of water. The Harry Potter theme is the shirt it's not just an added afterthought. I have no idea what the first thing you're trying to say means. The badger is the fish out of water because it eats other animals Lions don't Snakes don't Or the badger eats things that bite back so it's different What the hell are you talking about?. send message. I'm not sure what everyone is complaining about. It makes complete sense. The hufflepuff which is a badger is eating what most people think would be gross. So yeah lions eat other animals as well as snakes. Its just unusual and awkward that it is eating another hogwarts crest...which I think is awkward. Your argument of saying this shirt doesn't make sense is not valid. I think this shirt is clever and I think the artist put a lot of work into it. If you don't like it then don't vote for it. Don't waste everyone's time by writing a lengthy comment about how this shirt doesn't make sense. send message. why so mean to the snake no me gusta send message. It's really cute but i wish there's one where Slytherin overpowers the other houses too just to make it fair. send message. Badgers and honey badger are actually different species and look different. They aren't the same animal at all. The fact that this is a Harry Potter shirt makes it more on topic for me. The honey badge isn't a badger and also isn't acting like all of the other mascots which seem to be acting like students. It's not the strongest of fish out of water themed shirts but I think it fits. send message. Correct. But Honey Badger dont give a It's gonna be whatever it wants Honey Badger makes an awesome appearance in The Gods Must Be Crazy 2 one of my favorite movies of all time. send message. I just also want to say thanks for posting this I used to work a bit with photoshop a long time ago but never knew about halftones. You do some really great work so it's nice to get an idea of how the pros do it. send message. this shirt is amazing. will buy. send message. I love this shirt. I would point out how it's not at all off-topic but several others have already made enough points. This is the first shirt in a while I've been dying to have. Good luck. send message. Well played Absolutely love the double-joke of sorts here. Really enjoying this weeks entries overall Best of luck. send message. Thanks for clarifying that Diana. The other day when I first saw this I almost commented that it was not very on topic because I thought it was a regular badger wouldn't be out of place at Hogwarts duh!. Then I saw ramy's first comment about the honey badger and it all made sense.. Honey badger definitely don't fit in at Hogwarts but HONEY BADGER DON'T CARE. send message. Dude thanks for explaining some tone stuff for us. I've found that no matter what I do I can't get my halftones to look nice. : This is extremely helpful. send message. I'm not even a big Harry Potter fan and I know this isn't a Harry Potter shirt it's a double-theme shirt with Harry Potter mascots AND Honey Badger up the mascots the Hufflepuff mascot is an English badger with stripes on its face/head the shirt design is a honey badger. It's a design as opposed to obvious and cute I'm sorry you don't get it. send message. Really like this its phatasmic and I'm not even all that into harry potter. send message. It makes me sad that there are at least seven creative original ideas on the bottom barrel of this derby yet the same tired garbage from ramyb is in the top just like every time. They really need to instate some kind of times in x amount of time and you're not able to re-enter for days rule. send message. This is the only counterargument to mine that is at all logical. And I retract my off-topic post. If it is indeed identifiable as a honey badger then it is on topic. Thanks for clarifying the differences. I still think the shirt is BS but it is on-theme. send message. First of all interesting that you'd define this as but ok fine I won't argue that point. But the like every time is what gets me. I have had one other design that could possibly be defined as since the start of this year which ended in 16th place. So far this year I've had two designs that printed one of which was a watercolor tree and the other an abstract representation of inspiration the mind. Perhaps you check the derby an average of once every few months and have just gotten unlucky but I have been working hard to have a great deal of variety in my designs recently both in content and style. And don't worry alert!. this design is not going to print anyway so you can breathe a little easier. Anyway thanks everyone else for the kind words I'm glad to help with the halftone stuff and might put together a formal tutorial for different halftoning techniques that I have amassed over the years send message. It seems like someone has their cranky pants on today....Ramyb has a skill in creating both clever AND breathtaking images and I look forward to seeing what he has to offer each week. Keep creating Ramyb.. I enjoy seeing what you come up with each week send message. First I for one have enjoyed seeing you branch out and work different themes other than You definitely have been strengthening your craft. And second thanks tons for the discussion on halftones. I'd love to see you post a tutorial in one of the community threads. It'd be a terrific help to a lot of us amateurs and maybe some pros too. And third WANT TO HUG!. This is fogging what makes you think it won't print Neither the style nor the subject matter are my thing and I won't even opine on the But I see lots of votes going to it. Just curious why you don't see it printing. Spoiler. send message. Posted As for why I don't think this will print this is definitely a competitive fog and there are two designs that were posted after this one that fogged before it. I appreciate all the votes on this design but the chances of it making it higher than 8th or 9th seem pretty slim to me. I'd love to be wrong though :P. send message. At least it's not turtles but yes I kinda feel the same way. kakow wrote They really need to instate some kind of times in x amount of time and you're not able to re-enter for days rule. I don't agree with you on that part. Personally I don't have a problem with patrickspens printing a shirt almost every week also as long as it is solid design funny/clever and/or well executed I even happen to find that some ramyb designs deserved their printing. What makes me mad is to see that people keep voting blindly for ramyb's generic and overused designs preventing other designs often more original or better executed to print me to buy these by the way send message. LOVE IT. send message. I was hoping it would be a reference to this http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EIyixC9NsLI. send message. Wouldnt personally buy this one but I for one have noticed how you have branched out somewhat Ramyb and I for one appreciate that you are making that effort of moving forward with your work. send message.

Leave a Reply. Recent Posts. Categories. Meta. Archives. Website Statistics. Following is a step-by-step guide to creating a self-signed SSL certificate for apache2 on the Ubuntu Linux distribution. Procedures here are sufficiently different from my selfsign.html guide applying to other linux distributions that it warranted a separate document. Note that this document can be used a couple different ways. If you follow all the steps you’ll have a self-signed SSL certificate and a working SSL site. If you’d rather generate a Certificate Authority which you can use to sign multiple certificates then you should read this document my general purpose selfsign.html document and start with the section at the end of this document Generating a CA under Ubuntu. Preliminaries and Packages. If you have a registered DNS name be sure that you properly set it up. On the Gnome console System->Administration->Networking:General. Your host/domain name here should match the one you’ll be using in later steps. Use apt-get install apache2) Synaptic or some other tool to get and install apache2. You should also have openssl likely already installed. su to the superuser and make a backup of the original apache configuration file. Call it whatever you want. My practice is to add to any default configuration file before I make changes and a timestamp to later versions I modify whatever works for you. If this is the first time you’ve ever done this you may want to take backups at incremental change points. You should not make a backup of the file in the sites-enabled directory since both the original and backup will be loaded when you restart apache discovered this behavior. Also note that a symlink exists from to Instead back it up in the sites-available directory or some other location. Run the SSL certificate generating script. The script lacks the xxx flag and creates a certificate that only lasts a month by default. One visitor to this web page suggested that the script accepts standard arguments so you can pass additional flags to it. I’ve not verified this to be true yet but I’m almost certain he is correct. For example to generate a self-signed certificate that lasts one year. An alternative is to modify the script itself. If you open this script with an editor you can see that it’s just a thin shell over native openssl commands. Make a back up this script. You’ll see a portion in it that looks like this. Change it to this if want your self-signed cert. to last a full year. Then run the tweaked version answering the questions as they come. When you’re more comfortable working with openssl you can check out my other doc Creating a self-signed SSL certificate run the commands natively or modify this script further to suit your tastes. apache2-ssl-certificate. Enable ssl. Establish a necessary symlink. The first command copies the default configuration file for port 80 to use it as a stub configuration file for 443. The second command establishes a symlink from the ssl file to the file. The symlinking methodology between the two directories well as mods-available and mods-enabled is an arrangement briefly explained in The general idea is that enabled files exist as symlinks created to their available counterparts. Set up the document roots. The default location for HMTL pages with an initial install of Ubuntu is and there exists no separate place for ssl files. I prefer to serve up basic HTML pages in and SSL pages in Whatever works for you. But at this point I create the directories. Configure virtual hosts. Here you need to tell the apache configuration file the IP of your box DNS name any and document roots you just created in the previous step. To configure HTTP over port 80 Similar procedure for HTTPS over port 443 Instruct apache2 to listen to 443. Go to this file and add the following to it. Turn on the SSL engine. In the middle of file after the commented area which says Possible values include debug info notice warn error crit... add the following. Make an tweak need be and restart apache. When starting and stopping Apache there may be a complaint such as not determine the server’s fully qualified domain name using 127.0.1.1 for ServerName. You may encounter this if you don’t have a DNS name for your server and are just using a dynamic IP. If this applies to you go into your file and make the following changes. Basically we’ll be adding to the 127.0.0.1 IP and whatever system name you chose when you installed Ubuntu you’ve not changed it. The final line below should be there if you have a static IP and corresponding DNS name registered to it. If this is the case earlier steps that wanted ServerName should have a value which corresponds to the DNS name also indicated here. Restart apache. Done test it out. Generating a CA under Ubuntu. Skip this section unless you want to roll your own Ubuntu Certificate Authority using the openssl commands natively. If this is the route you want to take then you should get familiar with this document and my selfsign.html document. The gameplan in a nutshell. Follow steps on selfsign.html then copy the resulting server.key and server.crt files into There may be an apache.pem file sitting there at some point in the past you used the script supplied with Ubuntu to generate a certificate rather than openssl natively. You’ll note that this file may have a symlink aimed at it. Apache won’t need the apache.pem file or symlink any longer they exist. You’ll then do all of the steps in this document with the following exceptions you’ll skip don’t need to use the apache ssl generating script and in step you’ll not reference apache.pem it exists. Edit your file and remove any reference to etc/apache2/ssl/apache.pem. Instead add this. You’ll also need to run the script if you haven’t already done so. Go you and type ssl. If you look at this script it’s simply a general purpose utility to establish a symlink between a module in to give a message to the effect that a given module doesn’t exist or that it’s already symlinked for loading. Restart apache and test it out. Name Mail not be published Website.

What is the Domain Name System(DNS The DNS is the glue that keeps the Internet together. DNS translates domain name(example.com to an IP address and vice versa. It’s much easier for us to remember names than numbers. DNS is defined in Request for Comments 1034 and 1035. Basically any major Linux distro can be used as a DNS Web E-mail and FTP server and Suse is not an exception. All in one box and one static IP address. That’s all you need Of course I am talking about an experimental machine. An educative aproach. If you are seriuos about the Internet you are going to need minimun two DNS servers an email server a web server an FTP server a firewall machine may be using ipcop.org a proxy server etc. The DNS server is very easy to install. All you need to install is the BIND package modified the file and create your own zones files. If you are using any type of firewall keep port 53 open for UDP and TCP. This is the port dedicated to DNS. Edit and add your reference zone files. Right after the first reference zone file in this case zone add yours in my case I added two zone references enicaragua.net and sixbone.com. Pay close attention to the open and close braces quotes and semicolons. Zones files Suse puts the named dir in Here is where your zones file will be located. This is the sixbone.com domain’s zone file. Now we need to test the zone files so we type rndc reload next we run rcnamed start. You should get not erros. Next type rcnamed status you should see the number of zones running and the last line will say the server is up and running. If you get an error check braces quotes and semicolos in If you want to know more about CNAME A NS etc. Read The DNS Bind Book. Have you seen those sites that if you don’t put the www you cannot get to it Well it’s all in the zone files. If you check the sixbone.com file you see one reference with the www and one reference without it these are called CNAME or alias. Bingo By the same token you create the same way an FTP server so on and so forth. In the case of a Web server you need to check your Apache conf files and make sure that you create your virtual hosts reference as well. This is another topic. Finally I run the last check using dig your DNS friend and this is what I get. DNS is an exciting topic and these few lines don’t even put a dent to it. For example you need to register your own domain name with a domain name service provider. i.e ns.com buydomains.com etc. By creating these zone files in your server your DNS server is not going to work I mean it won’t resolve any domain name at all may be locally. How the DNS work Here is a link that explain very well how it works How DNS worksEach domain name must have two DNS servers. Some people named their ns1.example.com and ns2\,example\,com in my case I named mine unix.sixbone.com unix is the name of the machine itself or host name in the UNIX jargon. The first reference in the link above is the root level. These are a series of machines 13 total to be exact distributed around the world. I think Japan has two Europe has a couple more the US has the most etc. What are the names of these machines In your there is a file called root.hint this file contain the list of the these machines. Here is the file in my Linux box. The last machine listed in this root.hint file is locates in Paris France. Just use visualroute.com to find the rest. Keep in mind that we are a machine to the biggest network of the world The Internet. And this machine must be capable to let everybody know regardless where they are how to find example.com how to find this domain name and its contents. For a small local network you don’t need a DNS server you can use the first approach since the ARPANET’s days of resolving names to IP addresses the hosts file located in Name Mail not be published Website.

Leave a Reply. Recent Posts. Categories. Meta. Archives. Website Statistics. Though PHP presents a very versatile and user friendly interface for handling file uploads the default installation is not geared for working with files in excess of 2 Mega Bytes. This article will help you configure your PHP engine for handling such large file transfers. The php.ini File. All the configuration settings for your installation are contained in the php.ini file. Sometimes these setting might be overridden by directives in apache .htaccess files or even with in the scripts themselves. However you cannot over ride the settings that effect file uploads with .htaccess directives in this way. So let’s just concentrate on the ini file. You can call the phpinfo( function to find the location of your php.ini file it will also tell you the current values for the following settings that we need to modify. The first one is fairly obvious if you set this off uploading is disabled for your installation. We will cover the rest of the configuration settings in detail below. Files are usually POSTed to the webserver in a format known as The post_max_size sets the upper limit on the amount of data that a script can accept in this manner. Ideally this value should be larger than the value that you set for upload_max_filesize. It’s important to realize that upload_max_filesize is the sum of the sizes of all the files that you are uploading. post_max_size is the upload_max_filesize plus the sum of the lengths of all the other fields in the form plus any mime headers that the encoder might include. Since these fields are typically small you can often approximate the upload max size to the post max size. According to the PHP documentation you can set a MAX_UPLOAD_LIMIT in your HTML form to suggest a limit to the browser. Our understanding is that browsers totally ignore this directive and the only solution that can impose such a client side restriction is our own Rad Upload Applet. When the PHP engine is handling an incoming POST it needs to keep some of the incoming data in memory. This directive has any effect only if you have used the option at configuration time. Setting too high a value can be very dangerous because if several uploads are being handled concurrently all available memory will be used up and other unrelated scripts that consume a lot of memory might effect the whole server as well. These settings define the maximum life time of the script and the time that the script should spend in accepting input. If several mega bytes of data are being transfered max_input_time should be reasonably high. You can override the setting in the ini file for max_input_time by calling the set_time_limit( function in your scripts. The apache webserver has a LimitRequestBody configuration directive that restricts the size of all POST data regardless of the web scripting language in use. Some RPM installations sets limit request body to 512Kb. You will need to change this to a larger value or remove the entry altogether. If you expect to handle a large number of concurrent file transfers on your website consider using a perl or java server side component. PHP happens to be our favourite web programming language as well but perl and Java are just slightly ahead when it comes to file upload. Most installations of perl as an apache module can accept in excess of 32 megabytes out of the box. Compare this against the 2MB default for PHP. The downside is that perl coding takes just a bit more effort than PHP but it’s worth it. You can try our sample scripts to get started. Name Mail not be published Website.

Don't worry you can easily improve yourself by logging into your Woot account or signing up for a new one. We restrict voting to users who have purchased something from one of the other Woot stores. It's not just because we want your money we do it's the best way to be sure all the votes are coming from real people and not spam-bots or phony accounts. The best way we can think of anyway. For now. You can always get voting rights by buying something from one of Woot's other sites. Purchases through Deals.Woot don't count because in that case you're not buying anything from us. And we don't have your account information for those purchases. If you think you've bought something from Woot before and still can't vote make sure you're logged in with the same account you used to buy from us. Don't get us wrong. Negativity has its place. And downvotes are just as essential as upvotes when it comes to making Deals.Woot a useful place to find deals. But when your votes lean so heavily toward the dark side we have to wonder. Go vote up a few things. Accentuate the positive for a little while. It'll do you some good and it'll do the site some good too. Then you can get back to dealing out the smackdowns OK. Well that's a bit tricky. See we do a lot of stuff with your vote using it to work out the popularity of what you voted for compare that to all the other things voted on tally up our leaderboard work out your reputation. Someday we'll do a little cartoon showing just how hard your vote is working. Anyway taking votes back messes all that up so we give you five minutes in case you just mis-clicked. After that we've got to say no take-backs. Luckily votes are free so feel free to throw them around left and right wherever you see fit.

Beautifully designed it features pirate-themed pieces. Instead of the typical black and white sets these pirates canons come in vibrant blue and red sets so you can send these pieces to Davy Jonesâ€TM locker in style. The board is surrounded on all four corners with pirates. There are two drawers for each player to stow away his or her crew. Lightweight and elegant this set is both decorative and practical for usage. And for this price you practically did the plundering yourself. by belyndag added 10 hours ago This thread has come to our attention and we have checked into the matter.

Search.,An Open Letter from Conservative Leader James Bopp Jr. Mitt Romney for President. Share This. An Open Letter from Conservative Leader James Bopp Jr. Footer menu. Search. My Fellow Conservatives. Like all conservative Republicans and most Americans I believe that the future of our country and the preservation of our way of life depends on the defeat of President Barack Obama and his replacement with a president who supports free enterprise limited government traditional family values and a strong national defense based upon the principles of our United States Constitution. Because of my obligations with the Republican National Committee and my belief that any of the major Republican presidential candidates would advance our conservative principles I have stayed neutral hoping that one candidate would emerge with the demonstrated ability and support to take on and defeat President Obama. That candidate has now emerged and as a result it is time to put aside our minor intra-family differences to end the increasingly divisive primary fight and to unite to focus on achieving our shared goal of defeating President Obama. That candidate is Governor Mitt Romney. Mitt Romney is a true conservative. One does not have to guess what Mitt Romney would do in office. He served for four years as Governor of Massachusetts and has a record that conservatives should be proud of. As Governor Romney fought for social conservative values. He vetoed bills that would have authorized state funding of embryonic cloning would have changed the definition of human life from fertilization to implantation and would have given young women the morning-after abortion pill without a prescription. He promoted abstinence education in public schools. When the Massachusetts Supreme Court legalized same-sex marriage he left no stone unturned to set aside that ruling. And in contrast to the Obama Administrationâ€TMs war on the Catholic Church by mandating their institutions to provide contraceptives and abortion-inducing drugs in their health care plans Governor Romney vetoed a bill that would have required Catholic hospitals to offer abortion-inducing drugs to potential rape victims. Of course it is true that Romney had a conversion to the pro-life cause not unlike other Republicans such as Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush. We should not only embrace him as a result of this conversion but also recognize that he is a success story. But the best test of the sincerity of a conversion is deeds and Mitt Romney was pro-lifeâ as Governor according to the President of Massachusetts Citizens for Life. On the issues currently deemed the most important by the American people the economy and federal taxes and spending Romney also has a remarkable record. As a private investor in struggling businesses Romney was very successful in turning them around. As governor he issued more than 800 vetoes and cut taxes 19 times. The result in a state with an overwhelmingly Democratic legislature is that he closed a 3 billion dollar budget gap and turned it into a 2 billion dollar rainy-day fund. Mitt Romneyâ€TMs success in the first five primary states including wins in New Hampshire Florida and Nevada have revealed an emerging consensus among Republican voters that he is the most electable the most likely Republican candidate to defeat Obama. Romney has the broadest support among all elements of the Republican party electorate has the most appeal to independents and swing voters and is therefore the most electable of all. It is time therefore to celebrate the result and concentrate all our energy on achieving a general election victory. James Bopp Jr. Is A Campaign Finance Litigator And Constitutional Scholar. He represents numerous pro-life pro-family conservative and Republican party organizations from his law firm in Terre Haute IN. He also co-founded the Republican National Conservative Caucus and the RNC Conservative Steering Committee.

The Walking Dead While speaking with executive producer Gale Anne Hurd about the midseason premiere airing this Sunday I was sure to dig up that old chestnut about the freshman season-ending between Jenner the CDC scientist and Rick. Of course many had speculated at the time that Rick had learned that wife Lori was pregnant but Hurd now is willing to rule out that one theory seeing as Rick wouldnâ€TMt have been surprised to get the word a few episodes back. As for when we’ll learn what was disclosed by Jenner Hurd promises viewers donâ€TMt think your wait is too long.. White Collar Did anyone else get an unsettling vibe this week when Kramer by Beau Bridges shared with Diana his concerns about the NYC FBI office possibly being complicit with Neal’s sketchy endeavors Is he merely looking to do right or is he perhaps also operating off an agenda answers Tim DeKay. it’s extremely well-written in that his agenda is not Machiavellian. He’s not being evil with it and you’ll understand where he’s coming from. Nonetheless Peter would be wise to be very judicious in deciding whether to commute Caffrey’s sentence. As seen in the next episode which DeKay directed will realize his decision is going to not just decide Neal’s fate but possibly also decide his own.. Sitcom Scoops Ever wonder where The Big Bang Theory‘s Sheldon gets his very hairstyle You soon will find out when we meet his the guy who cuts his hair or much to Sheldon’s great horror the guy’s nephew who’s filling in for his regular barber... It looks like theÂ 2 Broke Girls savings is due for a setback when it falls upon Caroline to pony up the money needed to keep her incarcerated father’s lawyer around long enough for her to give her deposition...

If thereâ€TMs a show youâ€TMd like the Inside Line on emailÂ mattmtvguy@gmail.com and maybe itâ€TMll get some love the next time around Follow I don’t see the POI twist ending well for Fuscoe Chapman) since now that Taraji Henson is part of the gang he’s officially a redundant character. So funny I watched the first episodes and always said when he came on there’s the character that gets written off before the end of the first season.. I hope this isn’t true. I love Fusco’s sleazy edge. He’ll go places and do things like the surveillance on Finch and planting evidence that Carter wouldn’t do. I agree. Reece intimidates/deals with Fusco in a way he would not even consider with Carter. Him saying they were last night cracked me up. He had a hard time getting the words out. I don’t have a clue who that is I’ve seen every episode but don’t recall that name. Also what else is new about Collar being well-written of stretching that bit too thin over too long). Fusco is the NYPD detective that was dirty in the beginning but now works for the team originally under threat of blackmail. Reese sarcastically calls him by his first name I know the only thing I’m watching this week And As A true Housefan I’m gonna be glue to my tv for the 11 episode remaining(sadly!. )of the last season... Don’t care about the others shows...on the same night... Deto Love House so sad to see it end. Love Chase and I’m glad we can follow his POV. Hope for lots of House and Chase interactions. Jesse’s great. Can’t wait to see Jesse Spencer’s episode on House!!. I wonder if they’re going to go the who dies becomes a zombie route in the show. I’ll be absolutely watching the episode on House Jesse Spencer’s performance in Fault last week was awesome and I bet he does a great job with Hope he lands some cool movies or tv roles after House. he’s incredibly handsome!!. Too bad for Fusco to liking him but with him getting so little airtime and Carter now assisting Reese and Finch I can see his character leaving in one form or another can also be a red herring and he stays. At least Reese gave him a chance instead of knocking him off in the beginning. I’m pretty sure it’s already been mentioned Sheldon in one episode that Sheldon get’s his hair cut at SuperCuts. Of course he could have changed his mind since then.. As much as I love TBBT I hate the continuity errors. Sheldon used to love the hospital. He wanted to have his brain waves measured. He LOVED Leonard’s doctor girlfriend because she was their McCoy. Then he was freaked out by germs in the hospital Now he passes out at the sight of his own blood I don’t think so. Supercuts to NOT would be just one more of these continuity holes. Do the writers honestly think we don’t remember. Very intrigued by Kensi’s background on NCIS LA.. It sounds good Want to know why she joined NCIS LA and what she have done while she was in Hawaii. Can’t wait for those episodes. Jesse Spencer is an outstanding actor and the subtlety of his performance in Doubt blew me away. That was the best episode of House in years and I’m anxiously awaiting next weeks I’m especially happy to see that Chase’s faith will finally be addressed again. That guy can convey all sorts of emotions with his eyes without even saying a word. That scene in Fault” where Chase was being interviewed by Cofield was very impressive. It would be awesome if he ends up with an Emmy Golden Globe or SAG nomination for his work this season not holding my breath though. Jesse’s an asset to the show so sad that he was squandered for a number of seasons glad the producers finally got a clue before it was too late. Comments on TVLine.com are monitored.

L Style G Style co-founders and life partners Lynn Yeldell and Alisa Weldon will be recognized with the Visibility Award at the 2012 Austin HRC Gala. This award recognizes LGBT individuals who are living open and honest lives at home at work and in their greater community. The couple met at the Austin Gay and Lesbian Film Festival. Lynn found Alisa's energy and enthusiasm infectious and these same qualities became the foundation to starting L Style G Style. The couple talked with Austinist about being honored with the award the difficulties of living openly and honestly and their views on the Austin LGBT community. What doesÂ the Visibility Award mean to you How would you describe living open and honestÂ lives. Alisa:Â Having an organization as impressive as HRC recognize us is aÂ humbling honor. I feel and believe that living out and open is a social responsibility for us all. We won't change negative opinions if we don't create positive experiences for others to witness. Both Lynn and I are reminded daily that it's ok to be out every single day. For many fear of ultimate rejection from family and co-workers doesn't allow for ultimate personal freedom. I know that every time Lynn and I walk out of our house we're and we want every experience you have with us both personally and professionally to be one of integrity transparency and genuine openness. We represent the very essence of our business and we want nothing more than to create conversations and feeling of ease for those that engage us. Has itÂ ever been difficult for you to live openly and honestly. Lynn Throughout my career I have worked in some traditionally very conservative industries such as banking and wealth management. Thankfully the large majority of my colleagues have been welcoming and supportive but there still exists an undercurrent of discrimination and lack of understanding. I specifically remember a conversation with my branch manager at UBS who requested that I no longer display L Style G Style in the lobby of our office. It was a really sad day to watch the magazine which represented all that I stood for in being open and honest in my life be banned from the very place that I worked and spent the majority of my waking hours.Â Alisa Yes I lived in the closet with a design and marketing client of mine The Scooter Store from 2001-2004. Because the company had a strong family and somewhat religiousÂ culture when personal questions were asked during meetings I would steer clear of answering them with honesty. In all truthfulness I was afraid of sharing my personal life with them in fear of losing them as a client at the time. I'm happy to say that when they reengaged me in 2007 to do some projects for them I came out to them and my message was received warmly. My professional career began in 1994 and with all the businesses I've worked or with there were only a few that I stayed in the closet with primarily because religious aspects of company culture were overly apparent and public. What doÂ you think of the HRC's mission and how it applies specifically to Austin. Lynn First Austin is so wonderfully welcoming to most all types ofÂ diversity. So welcoming thatÂ when people visit they are a bit thrown off thatÂ we don't have a large and vibrant gay district. I think that it is a testament toÂ the work that HRC is doing across theÂ nation-working for equality. Austin just happens to be more evolved creatively and intellectually perhaps...though there is still much work to do. Another thing IÂ think of is that we are also a capital town. ButÂ how many friends do you haveÂ that step foot in those offices advocating for LGBT rights and advocacy I amÂ so thankful to HRC for their lobbying and advocacyÂ on a national level whileÂ also taking keen and active interests in pivotal local races. What hasÂ been your experience with the HRC so far. Lynn I have been active with HRC since my first Gala DinnerÂ in New Orleans in 1998 and have served in most all of the volunteer roles fromÂ Board of Governor\,Â Dinner Co-Chair and more. As with any non-profit advocacyÂ organization I have disagreed with a handful of positions they have taken in theÂ nearly 15 years ofÂ my involvement. But on the whole HRC is the oneÂ organization that I have been able to rely on to help take divisive issues suchÂ as Ask Don't Tell andÂ marriage equality and make realÂ change. Sure I would love to see change come faster but they are the onlyÂ organization that has made any consistent changeÂ on these issues.Â WhatÂ inspired you to start L Style G Style. Alisa I wanted to create something that was reflective ofÂ how I live my life leading a professional life giving back to my communityÂ and having my sexualÂ orientation be the last element of focus when firstÂ impressions are made. I wanted to focus on the positive aspects of those whoÂ have contributed to theÂ community and make it better who happen to be gay or lesbian. The way myÂ father was raised Baptist was the impetus of trying to changeÂ opinions of who the gayÂ community is in the eyes of the straightÂ community. It was his desire for me to be the best I could be and my grandmother's lessons on connecting to the community around you that drove me to create something any family could read and not feel awkward discussing or sharing. I wanted and want L Style G Style to be a positive experience that would inspire young gay and lesbian people to know that there life can be as important as others. How do youÂ think the magazine has changed the Austin LGBT community. Alisa I feel strongly that we have not only brought the lesbian and gay community together for those that don't know in past history we haven't played well together) but we have created a sense of inclusivity for us all-making being gay a non issue. I feel we've put a face to the gay community and while we don't have a size fits all representation I know for those outside the circle of the gay community have new interest in who we are what we do and what our story is all about. How do youÂ think it's changed Austin in general. Lynn Because we haveÂ free distribution throughout theÂ city we are accessible to everyone. We hearÂ numerous stories from straight allies who read the magazine for months withoutÂ realizing that all of the peopleÂ profiled on the cover all happened to be gay. That is one of the highest compliments we can receive as it is our aim to firstÂ tell the story of the person whichÂ ultimately opens minds and changes lives. LÂ Style G Style has provided unique access and coverage of our gay and lesbianÂ community showing that the mostÂ remarkable part about us is that we really thatÂ remarkable!Â How isÂ Austin's LGBT community different from other LGBT communities you may haveÂ lived in or visited. Alisa Growing up in Friendswood TX a highly conservative Quaker town is no comparison. I gravitated to Austin because I had heard that it was a welcoming community and it was ok to be out due to a fairly growing gay community. My reference is dated and at the time of moving here in 1993 Ellen DeGeneres hadn't even come out. With that said when we visit other cities and talk about what we do in Austin there is overwhelming response to launch L Style G Style for general awareness. What doÂ you hope for the future of the LGBT community in Austin. Alisa That diversity is welcomed throughout the community. The divisiveness I see with LGBT community becomes more cohesive and collaborative. Because the majority of highly supportive organizations supported by the LGBT community were founded at the beginning of the AIDS crisis I hope we continue to educate enlighten and garner the support of the greater community. I hope that businesses families and churches open doors to LGBT individuals with love compassion and support so that we all can just along. Most importantly I wish for the participation every LGBT person in Austin to live out come out support those that support us and vote. all our citiesone convenient app.

AIDS activist and patient Antonio Davis speaks in front of the Wilson Building yesterday on his case which goes to trial in May. On the same day in 2011 that Mayor Vince Gray members of the D.C. Council and more than 30 residents were arrested during a protest on Capitol Hill for D.C. voting rights Antonio Davis and 11 other activists were arrested outside the ceremonial office of House Majority Leader Eric Cantor as they angrily decried cuts to HIV/AIDS funding and needle-exchange programs in the District. But while Gray and the majority of those he was arrested with were allowed to pay a $50 fine and go on their merry way Davis who lives in Philadelphia faces trial in May and could well spend six months in jail if convicted of a single misdemeanor count of unlawful entry. Why Because he failed a drug test having tested positive for marijuana that his doctor has recommended he use to treat the AIDS he suffers from. After the April 11 arrest Davis and the 11 other activists were offered a standard Prosecution Agreement under which they had to stay away from the Cannon House Office Building for six months perform 32 hours of community service and test negative in three drug tests. If they did so within four months the charges against them would be dropped. By June they had all completed the community service and 10 of the 12 successfully came in negative in their drug tests. But for Davis and fellow protester David Goode the medical marijuana that their doctors have recommended they use to ease the pain and side-effects of their other AIDS medications registered in the tests. Having been assured by a judge that marijuana isn't screened for and having turned in letters from their doctors attesting to their need for the marijuana both expected that the U.S. Attorney for the District would honor the Deferred Prosecution Agreement. Matt Kavanagh and Davis. Photo by Larry Bryant. That never happened. Instead their case was transferred to a new prosecutor and then a third. All 12 activists were told that their first 32 hours of community service didn't count and were told to complete 32 more. By January 2012 Davis and Goode tested positive for marijuana again foregoing any alternative to a trial altogether. The nine others were told that they would have to do a third 32-hour stint of community service or similarly go to trial. repeated drug tests repeated unpaid community services and a half dozen court appearances is completely unreasonable on a charge for which city council members pay a fine and walk away from\, said Matt Kavanagh who is the Director of Advocacy at the Health GAP in the District and was arrested alongside Davis. But according to William Miller a spokesman for the U.S. Attorney for the District the prosecutors have followed standard procedure in Davis case. Additionally he noted Gray and the D.C. voting rights protesters were prosecuted by the D.C. Attorney General which would explain the different approaches. cases were handled consistently with the diversion policies of the U.S. Attorney’s Office. The case involving Mayor Gray and others had a different set of circumstances and was not handled by the U.S. Attorney’s Office. The District of Columbia Office of Attorney General handled that matter. The conduct in this particular case led to a charge of unlawful conduct on Capitol grounds a misdemeanor that is prosecuted by the U.S. Attorney’s Office. The U.S. Attorney’s Office requires defendants to pass drug tests to qualify for diversion\, he said. That's of little solace to Davis who says that he used marijuana one a week to counteract the side effects of the nine other medications he takes and to stimulate his appetite. been prescribed medical marijuana because it's the only the thing that helps me in my condition. I do not use marijuana as a substance to get high\, he said. The ongoing legal drama has taken its toll on him he says. He's given up using marijuana for the time being and has lost 20 pounds over the last two months. He's had to travel back and forth between Philadelphia and the District five times for hearings and he worries that a conviction would put his career as a paralegal in jeopardy. He also sees little humor in the fact that as of January D.C. Pre-Trial Services stopped testing for marijuana since his case predates the change in policy. He just wants this to be over. ask that Attorney for the District Ron Machen look in his heart to make a reasonable decision and let those enter into the Pre-Trial Services Diversion Program or drop the case and dismiss all charges against all protesters\, he said. http://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/DC-Homicide-Investigation-Inside-Bethesda-Fitness-Store-1178[more.

Photo by NCinDC Though it has always been accepted as common law yesterday the Virginia House of Delegates passed a measure that officially grants civil immunity to those who use deadly force against intruders reports the Washington Times. Known as the doctrine\, the measure merely codifies a person's right to shoot someone who breaks into their house and not face any legal liability for doing so. During the debate one Virginia legislator relayed a story of a constituent who had fired at an intruder and was taken to court for doing so as a justification for the law But Delegate Anne B. Crockett-Stark Wythe Republican relayed the story of an 82-year old constituent who caught a male burglar in her home one time held a gun to him and asked you want to eat breakfast with the devil?. Ms. Crockett Stark’s constituent fired at the intruder as he ran was taken to court and lost she said. The story garnered a standing ovation from the crowd.Critics of the measure complained that it was already accepted practice and that the law as written could allow homeowners off the hook for using deadly force indiscriminately. As of last year some 31 states have similar laws on the books or have established case law governing the use of deadly force in the home including Maryland. The District is amongst the few jurisdictions in the country with no explicit law on the matter. all our citiesone convenient app.

Lamont Peterson after his December defeat of Amir Khan at the Washington Convention Center Photo/Nick Wass After weeks of out-of-the-ring sparring over the result of their last bout D.C. native Lamont Peterson and Amir Khan will battle it out again on May 19 in Las Vegas. The Post reports that the two have agreed to re-fight the December match that Peterson won after the a split decision by the judges. Khan wasn't willing to let the super lightweight boxing championship belts go so easily though - he complained of ring-side shenanigans and filed appeals with two of the sport's governing bodies. The controversy reached such a fevered pitch that a D.C. Council committee went so far as to hold a hearing on the issue last week hoping to head off any damage to the city's reputation as a boxing destination. no surprise though that the rematch won't be happening here.. Regardless of the outcome it looks like the rematch will be good for both Peterson and Khan - the Post reports that they'll each be taking home $1.5 million just for stepping into the ring. Part of the agreement also stipulates that Peterson's next fight after the rematch be in the District. Predictably Peterson is already talking some good trash. just want to fight him again because it was a good fight.

The 1994 Violence Against Women Act and the 2007 law creating the visa\, which allows assault victims to win legal residency upon helping law enforcement prosecute their abusers have helped many D.C. area immigrant women who have been afraid that by going to the police they would risk deportation. Counter Counter Just why do so many D.C. coffee shops serve Counter Culture coffee It's not because it tastes good—in fact it's pretty watery. The City Paper's Alex Baca caffeinated her way through many of the at least 25 cafÃ©s and restaurants that serve the Durham N.C.-based roaster's beans. She finds that Counter Culture is so ubiquitous largely because of the free training it offers to baristas employed by coffee shops that serve only Counter Culture.

If you why so many well-dressed white guys were aimlessly walking around Woodley Park late this week it's because it's time for CPAC the annual conservative pow-wow. Yesterday we attended a dating seminar for conservatives and lamented that the Cooch didn't bring up D.C. rats during a speech. Today and tomorrow should be extra interesting though - Occupy D.C. protesters have pledged to protest the conservative gathering leading to wild allegations of potential violence. We'll be there. Corporate Contribution Ban Initiative Moves Forward A proposed ban on corporate contributions to political campaigns in the District is fair game to be put to the voters in the November election reports the Post. D.C. Attorney General Irv Nathan stated yesterday that the initiative proposed by activists Bryan Weaver and Sylvia Brown would not conflict with the Citizens United Supreme Court case that found that personal political contributions are considered free speech. Weaver and Brown have to gather some 23\,000 signatures to get the measure on the ballot if they succeed and voters side with them in the election corporate contributions to campaigns and a variety of political committees would be banned. Same-Sex Marriage Debate in Maryland Kicks Off Today Gov. Martin O'Malley will kick off the debate over whether or not to legalize same-sex marriage today in the Maryland House writes the Washington Times. At the same time a Republican lawmaker from Anne Arundel County is expected to propose a constitutional amendment that would define marriage as between a man and a woman. Same-sex marriage made it through the Maryland State Senate last year but stalled in the House. While O'Malley is putting more muscle behind the fight this year it still remains unsure if he has the support to move marriage equality a step further than it did last year. Virginia Closer to Allowing Adoption Agencies to Bar Gay Adoption The Virginia State Senate voted yesterday on legislation that would allow adoption agencies to deny placements based on religious or moral beliefs reports WTOP. Proponents of the measure say the clause merely protects the rights of private adoption agencies while opponents say it is simply a cover for the state to stop same-sex couples from starting families. After the District legalized same-sex marriage local adoption agencies similarly complained that they would have to place children with same-sex families Catholic Charities which received money from the city and would have to comply went as far as shutting down its foster care program.

Bagged Five-Cent Fee for Prince George's County Fails There's Still Hope. Other Interesting Stories. Comments send a tip. about. subscribe. Photo by sjshoreman This post has been updated. Despite a unanimous vote in support of a five-cent bag fee in the Prince George's County Council this week a Maryland State House committee voted the proposal down yesterday. The Post reports that the widespread support shown on the council did not extend to the Prince George's County delegation to the State House causing the measure to fail The bill needed broader support from the Prince George’s House delegation county affairs committee to win approval but fell short on a 3-2 vote. Prince George’s Dels. Carolyn Howard and James Proctor both Democrats voted no. Voting for the measure besides Frush were Dels. Jolene Ivey and Justin Ross. Del. Veronica Turner was absent. The measure can come before the panel two more times and the full delegation could take it up even without the panel’s endorsement.What provoked the opposition Lobbying from plastic bag manufacturers and concerns that the fee would hurt low-income residents. Both the District and Montgomery County have imposed five-cent bag fees and Maryland is considering a statewide measure doing the same. But without Prince George's County onboard it's unclear whether or not it will pass. UPDATE 11:30 a.m. Not all hope is lost though People with knowledge of the issue note that another vote is coming and the House committee could eventually vote for the bag fee. the bill is dead is simply not true. That 3-2 vote was in favor --we just needed 4 votes to get the stamp of approval from County Affairs. It still can move forward without that approval and it gets another chance to get the approval next week. Perpetuating the idea that the bill is dead is really hurting our effort\, wrote Julie Lawson of the Anacostia Watershed Society in an email.

Other Interesting Stories. Comments send a tip. about. Contribute. subscribe. Photo by Chris Reif The D.C. Taxicab Commission announced yesterday that it would restore a baggage-handling surcharge that it had originally removed from a fare increase proposal that will likely take effect in the coming months. Under the current fare structure riders can be charged 50 cents for every bag above and beyond a first one which rides for free while trunks cost $2 each. As part of a fare increase proposal presented by the commission in December per-mile rates would increase from $1.50 to $2.16 but most of the existing surcharges would be scrapped - including the baggage and trunk surcharges. That news angered many drivers who claim that the only thing sustaining them is those very surcharges. At yesterday's hearing Commissioner Ron Linton said that he had taken into consideration driver and rider comments in reinstating the baggage fee. The new fee won't apply to bags of groceries purses or similar type bags and Linton said it would only apply to bags that are physically handled by a driver. The trunk surcharge remains out of the new proposal. Linton also reinstated a $1 additional passenger charge but only for vans and allowed drivers the means to gain an exemption to a rule that allow passengers to carry small animals with them but only if the driver can show proof of an allergy. Additionally the commission included a $15 flat fee to metered rates during snow emergencies currently a cab driver can charge 125 percent of the regular fare during a snow emergency. The amended fare increase proposal will again be published in the D.C. Register where it will be open to 30 days of public comment. all our citiesone convenient app. http://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local/DC-Homicide-Investigation-Inside-Bethesda-Fitness-Store-1178[more.

Creating a Happy Healthy Harmonious Home Using Feng Shui Interior Design http://bit.ly/zz4SlK Ready for more amazing design ideas Check below. Post a Comment. Today. This Week. This Month. Latest articles. About Freshome. Previous J Next K As many of you will be aware Feng Shui is the study and analysis of the interaction between people buildings and the environment and can be used to enhance our quality of life. According to Feng Shui experts the atmosphere or chi of a building and its close surroundings have an influence upon our life patterns and outcomes. By getting the Feng Shui in our homes right we are able to create a supportive environment that can help us to succeed and flourish in our homes and work spaces. But how exactly does Feng Shui work and what is the best way to go about creating a happy healthy and harmonious home using Feng Shui In order to answer these questions we consulted Feng Shui Master Sarah McAllister who founded the UK-based Feng Shui Agency back in 2003. Sarah has 14 years Feng Shui experience and a number of prestigious UK and international Feng Shui projects in her portfolio and is founder of the first Chue Feng Shui school to be accredited by the Feng Shui Society UK. She has been very influential in introducing Feng Shui to the more conventional and mainstream of society rather than the more new age audience that it is readily associated with. Can you please start by telling us about the Feng Shui Agency. SM. This is a unique company established by me in 2003 incorporated in 2005 with a dual focus on both Feng Shui design/consultancy and teaching. We are recognised as the first Feng Shui Interior Design and Feng Shui Architecture company in the UK and we are based in London and Oxford. We have clients from all over the world and increasingly work internationally including places like Moscow Tokyo Milan and Dubai to name but a few places we have projects. We have also established the Feng Shui Agency Chue Style School which reflects the fact that we practice and teach mostly Chue Style Feng Shui which has a lineage all the way back to the Imperial Courts of China. I am the main Feng Shui consultant and work closely with other Feng Shui expert colleagues as demand requires. I have personally fully trained a few graduates to represent me on smaller jobs as required. I like to keep flexibility in the team so I currently do not employ anyone.ï¿1⁄2 But I do have a couple of great interior designers and architects who help me as the need arises on those projects requiring full architectural or interior design. The business is highly mobile and once we have done the first site visit we can work from anywhere in the world depending on the follow up requirements of each individual project. Some projects need regular site visits and other commissions can be carried out remotely. You established the Agency in 2003 but how did you first become interested in Feng Shui SM. I first became interested in Feng Shui at the age of 14 possibly even earlier as I was always the kid lingering the longest in nature and zoning out in a meditative space. I used to regularly re-arrange my bedroom trying out new positions for the bed and lighting etc. My father used to teach Judo in his spare time so I was on the mats in the dojo from about age four and at home were plenty of books on Judo Tai Chi and Karate. I also learned Wado Ryu Karate and Wing Chun Kung Fu as a hobby. I was immersed in Eastern principles from very young age. What do the words Feng Shui actually mean and where does it originate from. SM. Feng means wind and Shui means water and this relates to both the physical masses of water ocean river etc and the winds but is also a metaphor for earth energy and heaven energy moving on and around the planet we inhabit. Lets face it the world is an organic being not just a map which we walk drive eat and sleep upon. I think the green movement has been wonderful for Feng Shui as people are realising now more than ever how the world is sentient and interconnected and how we treat our space directly affects us. The idea with Feng Shui is to gather the energy for our health and happiness and activate or disperse it gently with the wind. Where you find water you will find life and the heaven energy is also held by the water wind slows down when contacting water. Architects I have worked with have acknowledged the power of water as they understand how it emits negative ions which attract the human energy field and why many people feel happier after a shower a thunder storm with rain etc as the water has a cleansing and revitalising effect. Can you describe the purpose of Feng Shui. SM. Originally Feng Shui was used primarily for health as it is one of the 8 Brocades of Chinese Medicine including Acupuncture\,ï¿1⁄2 Meditation Herbalism Nutrition Tuina Massage Tai Chi Chi Kung and Astrology. Originating mostly in rural China by farmers who needed to understand nature to give them the best chance ofï¿1⁄2 successful crops the knowledge was then perceived by the travelling scholars who brought it back to the Imperial Courts of China where astrologers astronomers and political advisors started to develop the rudimentary systems and sought to use it to help the Emperor’s rule. Over the years it then became popular in business and politics and no one can argue about the enormous success of Hong Kong as a financial capital and this is very much based on Feng Shui. Although Feng Shui originated in China it is universally applicable and does not require people to understand Chinese folklore in fact there is still a group of Feng Shui consultants throughout the East that perpetuate superstitious nonsense because they haven’t had the right training. They don’t help the public relations of the industry and of course the press love to pick up on the failings of these people. How can incorporating the principles of Feng Shui into our homes help us to live a better life. SM. Feng Shui is not just about techniques to try to master a situation and improve your fortune but at a deeper level it is also about your soul and its journey. It isn’t just about how to maximise your luck all the time for your own gain but it is also about asking yourself how you can contribute to the world. For example it could be that a high ranking official asks my advice on his or her horoscope and I say that actually they would be happier as a yoga instructor or whatever the situation that is a stereotypical example. If clients can engage with the deeper thread of what is being offered then I can support them and their families over years rather than one off consultations. This is my preferred business model as it rewards me for being extra committed to them and it rewards the client because they have access to wonderful knowledge and our able to implement the knowledge more often in their lives. Your services can help people create a space that is entirely customised to their own unique energy constitution from the colours on the walls to the layouts of the rooms materials and orientation of beds desks sofas etc. How do you go about discerning somebody’s energy constitution And how does this relate to the layout and colour scheme of their house. SM. Each one of us has a unique blueprint and there are many factors that go into an assessment but it is primarily the year month date and hour of birth which creates the Ba Zi Four Pillars horoscope. This provides astonishingly accurate detail on a person’s ability to marry conceive have a good career be healthy and wealthy have personal and official power etc. Most of life’s issues and concerns can be seen in the horoscope through the interplay of the Five Elements of Water Wood Fire Earth and Metal. We then take this information and where possible combine it with the Feng Shui readings so that the clients sleep in the best room face the best way when working from home etc. This is a good place to point out that many people can and will do well whatever position they sleep or work in and Feng Shui must not be considered the be all and end all. It is simply a tool to use if a client wishes to maintain or improve upon their existing success by tapping in to this wisdom. Or it can help someone who seeks our advice because life isn’t going how they want it and theyï¿1⁄2 keep on having persistent bad luck bad health or they are unhappy in this case we look to alleviate unnecessary suffering by figuring out if their Feng Shui is hindering them or not. I make it very clear from the point of enquiry that Feng Shui accounts for approx 30 influence on your overall luck levels and that it isn’t a cure all and I don’t profess unrealistic benefits. I also adopt a very supportive coaching style so that the clients don’t feel neurotic about their space Many have contacted me as they have read a few books and I quite often reassure them about certain aspects of their home. It goes to show that reading a book can turn people into armchair practitioners for whom a little knowledge is dangerous. Your company offers a consultation service giving practical advice helping people to improve the Feng Shui in their homes. What analysis methods do you use during your consultation process and what are the most common problems that you come across. SM. We start outside having a look around the immediate area for problematic or supportive features in the nearby environment such as pylons/power plants/excessively tall trees etc and figure out if these are affecting the client’s property and if a cure needs to be put in place which would then be worked out in conjunction with other exterior techniques I aim to achieve one action for three reasons or one suggestion for three results because Feng Shui takes a truly holistic look at the property. Then we move inside and meet the client having already figured out how the physical form is affecting the property. Following a quick chat with client during which we reestablish their goals and how I can help I start at the back of property and look again at exterior influences as these are 60 of the influence on a property with a garden. Only once I have received an instinctive impression of the property and the client will I then proceed to the measurements taken with the Chinese Lopan Compass like any other compass it aligns to magnetic north and is much more accurate than a mobile phone app compass. The orientation of the property tells us certain information based on specialist techniques. The most common problems that I’m brought in to help with are relationship issues bickering kids and adults sleeping poorly feeling drained career confusion lack of clients poor health or kids getting into trouble at school with authority figures or peers. Also people like to get me involved when they move to a new house or office with our Property Selection Service and when they are building a new building or refurbishing/extending an existing one. They want to get off on the right foot and if spending on a refurbishment of course they want to make sure the colours and layouts and landscaping are Feng Shui optimised so they don’t have to redo everything. Businesses also contact me to seek advice on finding a good new office premises. Are there any rooms in the house that are more important to get right and if so why. SM. Realistically you need only concern yourself with spaces where you or your family spend a significant amount of time like the bedrooms home study and kitchen. I am a strong believer that Feng Shui needs to be practical in its application and I seek to support clients in understanding the important solutions and recommendations and that they need not worry about every last tiny detail of a space. Can you please tell us about a project you have worked on recently that you considered to be most interesting and why was that. SM. In November I started advising on an Ecobulid project near Bath in Wiltshire in the UK which was quite challenging because the designs had already been approved by local planners and even though I proposed some changes to see if the designs could be approved it would have involved a lot of architectural re-drawing so the client just accepted that I would try to fix any problems without too much upheaval to the design. I worked hard to find solutions that could be implemented to improve the Feng Shui. The site was on a level plateau which then sloped away quite steeply so I suggested a Flowform water feature to help keep the chi from dropping away and also to activate a good double mountain as we call it in terms of directions. I also had to find places for the extensive external art collection of the client ranging from ironcast lions to coloured glass panels and a Degas ballet dancer. I also advised placing an uplit Buddha towards the rear of the property. Internally I managed to get the front door changed to a better angle and changed from double doors to single and to get the right colours in the interiors white or white with hint of green. I also insisted on changes to the shape of the artist studio outhouse which would otherwise have been very detrimental to the woman wanting to work in it. I also helped design the reflection pool just outside the living area which will look stunning and suit a Feng Shui purpose too. It was an interesting project because it challenged me to be creative in my solutions to what was quite a fixed situation and it was gratifying that the clients interior designer and architect who were all very open and positive about Feng Shui. Ideally I would have been commissioned at the very outset but some positive changes are better than none at all I am an optimist essentially. For people living in rental accommodation where drastically modifying the layout of the house is not an option how else can the principles of Feng Shui be used to create a positive environment within the house. SM. People renting can commission a property selection service so that they are signing up for a property that suits them from a Feng Shui perspective if this is the case then what they do inside is less important because the main frame of the accommodation suits them. They can also position freestanding items such as lights statues appropriate not in case of Muslim clients) plants beds desks etc so that they are at least benefiting as much as possible even if they can’t repaint the room or afix things to walls etc. Obviously they are more limited than homeowners but can still benefit from the advice of an expert. I don’t advocate DIY Feng Shui as it is potentiallyï¿1⁄2 dangerous. Not everybody can afford to hire a Feng Shui Consultant or get advice from a professional such as yourself. What can people do to learn more about the benefits of Feng Shui and how it can help improve both their homes and their lives. SM. Feng Shui is not a self-help or DIY topic as it is so deep and complex so people can gain only very limited skill through reading a few books in their free time. More often than not books cause people confusion and despair The heart of Feng Shui is mastering natural energies therefore it is exceptionally powerful which is why the best professionals train for many years to master the skill and are continually learning more. There is both a scientific and method based aspect and also intuition that develops and refines over years of experience. If people can afford holidays nice handbags etc then they can save towards a consultation it is just a question of priorities and their ranking of values. For those in genuine financial hardship we offer student consultations where I visit a home or office with my students to allow them practical experience in a real life situation. The host benefits from the feedback from the students plus I give some more advanced advice if I deem it necessary to help them. What are your top Feng Shui dos and don’ts. SM. DOs. DON’TS. What would you say to the sceptics who believe that Feng Shui is a load of nonsense. SM. Don’t ridicule something that you haven’t tried or haven’t studied in depth. They would be advised to remember that quantum physicists are proving time and time again that the ancient beliefs from many indigenous peoples that were previously considered superstitious or primitive are now being shown to be very sophisticated and correct. It is actually astoundingly simple the world is simply an arrangement of energy whether human animal mineral physical energetic emotional mental etc. The environmental energy surrounding us is linked to our own psyche and energy field and can affect us for good or for bad Feng Shui seeks to combine the human with nature and help to create a supportive environment. In 2007 I did a diploma in Environmental Psychology at Birkbeck College in London as I wanted to learn whether the principles of Feng Shui could be explained with the more westernised language of Environmental Psychology and there are many parallels. Of course our environment affects us or why would we be interested in aesthetics or certain colour palettes or art of opera Sound music colour space it all works together to form our environment influencing our perception and therefore our feelings and thoughts which have a significant impact on our ability to be healthy harmonious and wealthy. The macro environment of our homes offices etc affects the micro environment of our own body and mind. If you were to give one tip to Freshome readers for something that they could try at home which would allow them to test the benefits of Feng Shui what would it be. SM. There isn’t really one tip to apply to all situations as depending on the sickness a different remedy is prescribed. Reducing Feng Shui to tips is like asking a brain surgeon to give their top tip on how to remove a clot on the brain it is impossible without the audience having gone through medical school. Similarly with Feng Shui the layperson simply hasn’t had the training required to understand the more powerful techniques of Feng Shui so the tips inevitably end up sounding rather simplistic and do not do the subject justice. In fact some tips can be dangerous which is why I try to keep mine on my blog as generic as possible and will not tell people anything they can’t handle as it is not responsible and could potentially damage someone. But one piece of advice that everyone can put into practice and is safe to use is to make sure you have a nice high headboard behind your bed. You’d be amazed how many people move in to a house and forget to buy the headboard. It creates an important stability to the bed that is psychologically reassuring even if mostly subconscious. Yes you can get by without one but it is far nicer and far more supportive to have one. For those of you who wish to learn more Sarah McAllister is running an Introduction Course on March 31st April 1st at Regents College in London.

Twitter buzzTweet. Print. Posted 10 February 2012 09:38am by Stephen Croome with 7 comments Google’s Panda update was a direct attack on bad content which comes in many different flavours including duplicate weak thin and template. Panda acts like a domain wide penalty so your whole site is affected and your good pages are dragged down by your bad pages. This is a guide on how to find and fix Google's Panda algorithm update based on our Panda fighting experience at SEOgadget in 2011. Often badly designed Information Architectures compound the problems with already week content. Large sites that have many pages templated content and lots of sub-categories are the most at risk. If you haven’t been monitoring and fixing your accessibility issues as highlighted in Google Webmaster Tools you are at risk. All of these examples are from the UK mostly from the employment and gift sectors. We use Searchmetric's SEO visibility score to find out just when sites got hit or recovered from Panda. There are three dates that stick out in the UK data. You can see in this graph that they are trying to fix their Panda issues but haven’t yet bitten the bullet and made the leap they need to. I know these guys well. They have no idea this data exists or anything about panda but they have done OK. One might argue that they are OK because they couldn’t care less about SEO and have a product that people like. It would be easy to attribute this to Panda but this looks more like developer or general website issues. One of my favourites from the Employment industry which clearly shows winners and losers. I love the green line. Did they even know they had benefited from Google Panda Did they think they had done something to deserve the new traffic. Was it all Champagne cocaine and cash bonuses and then three months later the next panda update smacks them. With Panda thinning out sites in a vertical it creates a false sense of success for the winners as they themselves may be next in line for the chopping block.. The blue line benefits from the first Panda update and then it looks like they get hit by Panda a few months later but I don’t think that’s Panda I think that’s development gone wrong. Panda smacks and recovery are one day to the next not across a number of weeks. Given this graph where would you go to look for examples of sites that are being rewarded by Google Panda. Find the websites that benefitted from Panda and look at their content as that is now the new minimum level of content quality in your industry. This data is for Prezzybox who we worked with. Panda recovery is possible but a lot of unplanned un-budgeted blood sweat tears and money went into that dip and recovering the traffic. The SEO visibility metric is a proprietary metric but I asked Steve Overton from Searchmetrics if he could give us some more insight into it and he has explained the algorithm behind it. Panda is confusing if you are not on top of your data and industry news. There were so many updates it becomes easy to blame everything bad on Panda. Conversely there are sites which benefitted from Panda but did not attribute it. When we started exploring how to fix Panda we moved quite conservatively. Now we suggest that people take strong decisive action in resolving issues. Google Panda doesn’t fix itself you have to fix it. It will take time money and effort. It also requires a change in how you see your online business. You can make this whole process a lot easier on your business if you put a person in charge of content and give them a budget and developer time. The advice is quite simple concentrated around a few key areas. The implementation is where companies fall down. Fixing Panda is not complex but it does require a lot of work. Give someone the responsibility to hunt down duplicate content. Use Google Webmaster tools or SEOmoz tools or Xenu or an IIS crawl whatever people suggest in the blog comments. It’s not tough to do it just requires some concentrated effort. Solve duplicate content issues with rel=canonical. Here are seven short videos of Google’s Matt Cutts talking about different aspects of implementing rel=canonical. If you have a section that is just thin templated content it is hurting the good contents ability to rank. Be strong and cut the crap or add to your content to improve it. Cutting the crap. 404 a bad section or area and after the pages have dropped out of the index 301 them somewhere good so you don’t lose any incoming link juice. This is potentially the biggest win. SEOmoz has a good guide to 301s including links to references for 301s under Apache and IIS. Making your content great. There is no getting around the fact that time and effort is needed here. Someone in your organisation needs the time and responsibility to sit down and create great content or manage the creation process via third party writers. I believe that great content requires both qualitative and quantitative research and a knowledgably person to knit it together to suit both users and search engines. Here is my guide on taking mediocre content and making it great content and an overview from our work on Panda on how Google might interpret content quality signals. Templated content. Write content hire interns or find people in cheaper parts of the world. Many companies are unnecessarily precious about their content and ultimately this ends up hurting more than helping them. Elance Odesk and Copify all work for building out content. you now have a person responsible for content quality who will oversee this. Accessibility issues. Run an IIS crawl to find your accessibility issues is easier to use than you think. Here is an example list of errors from an IIS crawl. This becomes your plan of attack for clearing up accessibility issues. You will end up with a list of issues and the urls where those issues are occurring to be able to go and fix them. The world is not as it once was. Crap websites trying to masquerade as decent websites are being hunted down and sunk below the quality line. Google owes you nothing. Tactics to just barely raise your quality enough to recover your rankings are unlikely to pay dividends. You may well find yourself a loser again the next time the quality bar is raised. Google is judging you. Google is going to continue to raise the quality bar with future updates. When your competitors improve their websites you will be weakest and in line for the chop at the next quality update. credit tanakawho via Flickr.

Founder at Alpha Content. 3:05PM on 10th February 2012. You may be right that companies are unnecessarily precious about their content' but I'm not sure that's the real problem. I'd say that they're precious about the wrong things. Companies should be precious demanding insistent on really good content. But that's content that's absolutely right for their customer. It's not stuff that makes the board feel good. Head of SEO Operations at SEOGadget. 5:05PM on 10th February 2012. Thanks for the comments I really appreciate them. Nick I agree you need to be careful and there should be someone on the client side who checks the content as part of the content delivery process.

Posted 08 February 2012 11:49am by Graham Charlton with 20 comments Aaron Wall recently reported on a Google employee who left comments on Hacker News to the effect that SEO is bad for the internet. The Google employee Googley Jon Rockway said that isn't good for users or the internet at large. It's a surprising statement for a Google employee to make and I've been asking some SEO experts about their views on the issue and whether this reflects the search giant's real views. Instead of being able to SEO the entire Internet businesses can now only affect the search results for a tiny percentage of users. That's a good thing because SEO can't scale and SEO isn't good for users or the Internet at large. If you look at the Google experience from the standpoint of customers it's pretty good. Users get relevant search results and ads. Advertisers get their content on top of everything else. It's a good compromise between advertising and usability and it works really well. It's a bug that you could rank highly in Google without buying ads and Google is trying to fix the bug. Manipulating Google results shouldn't be something you feel entitled to be able to do. If you want to rank highly in Google be relevant for the user currently searching. Engage him in social media or email provide relevant information about what you're selling and generally be a match for what the user wants. Search consultant Rishi Lakhani feels that Rockway has by revealing what could be a very much internal sentiment by Google on their stance on free traffic. It kind of reminds me of an old SEO joke What is the Meaning of SPAM Search Positions Above Mine. However in Google’s view SPAM could mean Search Positions Avoid Moneymaking. Essentially what is Google’s money making model Selling Ads. Every bit of free traffic that a site receives from organic search is a loss in revenue to Google. So are you surprised at this stance I am not. Andrew Girdwood Bigmouthmedia I have a lot of sympathy for Rockway’s comment. SEO that attempts to manipulate Google’s Bing’s search results so that less relevant results are returned above more relevant results is not good for users or the internet. I don’t believe there is a single any more. Some of the SEO throwbacks and perhaps some of the new strands do fall into the helpful category. Spam for example is not helpful. Yes there are plenty of spammers out there but good SEO has benefits for businesses and web users. Here are just a few of those. As Site Visibility's Kelvin Newman points out many improvements to website usability have been made in order to optimise for search engines There’s lots of annoying aspects of websites that SEO has had a role killing off I think the good Karma for SEO ending the trend of splash pages is enough to see the industry through a decade of bad behaviour. Elizabeth Ayers from iCrossing echoes this sentiment If large quality brands did not optimise their sites for search then it is likely that the web would be a poorer place. The web and social would not be as advanced as it is today if SEO hadn’t been such a key revenue driver for brands to take advantage of and participate in creating quality content and participating on social platforms. Content is key to great SEO and cheap tactics like keyword stuffing just don't cut it any more. Instead creating content that people want to read and share is what works best. Andrew Girdwood. Modern SEO is helpful. It is less an advertising tactic and more a marketing strategy. Modern SEO involves creating and working with engaging content content so good that users want to share and discuss it. This is a boon for users and the net as it creates an upwards pressure on quality. Rishi Lakhani. Competitive SEO actually helps make businesses even more relevant to searchers. Because we know who links naturally and why. A page full of carburettors for sale may not get links what is the motivation But a page that shows how to clean your carburettor will. The difference between intent and motivation differs and it’s the SEO community that is hard at work encouraging such content. SEO is not bad for the user but for Google’s pockets. There are businesses spending big bucks on SEO and paid search but by using solid SEO techniques creating a usable site and filling it with great content small businesses can rank higher than bigger rivals. Andrew Girdwood. A strong example of how Modern SEO is great for users in general is in the emergence of social CRM. Businesses are increasing their efforts to look after customers online using platforms like Twitter and Google to reach out to people who have had a bad experience with a brand or encountered some other problem. This is in part due to the rise of social but this is also an example of Modern SEO. Google blogged back in 2010 that being bad to your customers is bad for business. Customers benefit whenever brands take extra effort to look after them and the convergence of search and social have given business extra incentive to do just that. Is this the real subtext of this statement gaff or not As Rockway says thanks to recent changes such as Plus' the amount of Google homepage real estate which is open to influence by SEO is shrinking. So is Google seeking to minimise the role of the SEO Rishi Lakhani feels strongly about this. Of course there are bad approaches to SEO. However this attitude that SEO=SPAM should stop. Because the biggest violators are Google themselves. It takes content from third party sites and slowly wraps it up with ads. Google gets into short term partnerships with businesses with an edge learn their processes use those to build up their own offering and then terminate those relationships. Up to a few years ago Google used to use Yell to supply local content. Now it’s overtaken by Google Local. For years Google has been taking money from credit card companies and comparison sites alike. Now it has launched its own version which it uses Adwords to push.

I would like to share a post I wrote in Feb. 2011 on Good SEO Contributes To The Larger Objectives Of The Web Ecosystem. http://blog.webpro.in/2011/02/how-good-seo-contributes-to-larger.html. A good co-incident that this kind of discussion has come up in Feb. again this year.. 12:49PM on 8th February 2012. Great article that poses a good question As an SEO I get this question quite often. The article really touched on some good points. One in particular in that SEO is not bad for the internet but actually is good in that it improves usability of the web. 1:14PM on 8th February 2012. Optimisation of social based algorithms as Edgerank have consequences even worse than what SEO's have added or taken away from search based algorithm optimisations. Social networks rely on recommendation algorithms that can be gamed. The worst part of a social recommendation algorithm is the potential to create an eventual affect where users become hugely small-minded and less about more' more and ceasing to ask more. To know more about the bubble affect watch this lecture.. http://www.ted.com/talks/eli_pariser_beware_online_filter_bubbles.html. Senior Marketing Manager Personalisation MVT at Tesco.com. 1:16PM on 8th February 2012. This hits it on the nail for me bit of free traffic that a site receives from organic search is a loss in revenue to Google.. There seems to have been a very different stance to running Google with Larry Page as CEO which I'm not convinced will endear users to Google. The don't be evil tool is a great example of how Google have changed as a company as the tool states the relevancy of results is still as good as ever however there's a different commercial agenda at Google now Google are entitled to run Google how they think it should be run but with any long standing the core values are built up through trust and awareness over time. Trust is being eroded away and what was once a fairly clear set of core values seems murky. It does sound like internal sentiment as to what Google thinks of SEO but good SEO improves the quality of what Google returns. Its a WIN:WIN for both Google and SEOs one cannot work without the other especially since the Google rely on proper website structure which the majority of SEOs have helped develop over the last decade. This article still rings true for the 2 areas where google may slip-up quality of results and overdoing the social drive http://www.zdnet.com/blog/btl/new-google-ceo-larry-page-here-are-your-top-two-priorities/46912. CTO at EXPANSYS plc. 1:19PM on 8th February 2012. It certainly encourages index optimisation considerations over real-world usability and cars all built using a windtunnel results in homogeneous looking sites for any sector. 1:21PM on 8th February 2012. you want to rank highly in Google be relevant for the user currently searching. Erm that's called SEO. Granted there are many flavours of SEO some more oily than others but for many organisations SEO is an essential part of running a business online. The goals of SEO should simply be to improve editorial and technical quality to mention competitiveness which results in a better UX all round. Without SEOs who helps raise the editorial bar journalists still neglect copy that they believe is invisible) who ensures that slavishly produced content is optimised to the people that are looking for it most who checks for damaging site errors often people who should have clocked them have not who ensures pages are coded to proper standards so that they are discoverable in search. While you could nominate other company roles to all of the above truth is most of the time they're just cleaning up someone else's mess. So really SEO done the right way is about improving the web not ruining it. Owner at Digital Juggler. 1:45PM on 8th February 2012. Hi Graham I think this is a timely article. SEO is not inherently bad diluting quality is. Some of what Rockway said is bang on the money you want to rank highly in Google be relevant for the user currently searching. However he positions his opinion poorly. Positive SEO is about being relevant if you're not relevant you'll just get poor metrics and people won't come back. I think Rishi's last comment is quite interesting Google taking 3rd party content and wrapping it with ads. It's all about the money to them I don't believe anymore that the focus is on the user. The focus is on driving revenue and they have to think about the user to achieve that. SEO is an innate thing it can't be bad it's the people behind it that are choosing whether or not to follow good or bad practice. So let's focus praise and criticism on the people doing not a marketing discipline. thanks james. 2:01PM on 8th February 2012. 1stly clever bait article guys. 2ndly. SEO is not spam. Matt Cutts already said so. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BS75vhGO-kk&feature=player_embedded. 3rdly how can seo that encourages good web practices such as having a stable and sound site architecture encouraging good content and userbility helping a website serve the most relevant page possible to a searcher be a bad thing. and lastly this guy has probably just revealed the most damnning evidence of what every seo knew all along seo profiling and delberate penalization of sites that do not rely on google ads. any wonder why affiliate and ecommerce sites were the biggest sites to be hit by panda what about the keyword provided crap cmon people. i hope the investigitons into google's competition laws get wind of this. 2:06PM on 8th February 2012. I feel this Googler slipped up on his choice of wording about SEO. His opinion harks back to the stigma associated with SEO of 5 years ago.. back then SEO was regarded as trying to outsmart Google by looking for loopholes. People did exploit these methods until they were closed off but sites that were ranking falsely genuinely didn’t add to the user experience. Many of these websites were affiliate sites or sites littered with adverts. SEO’s should be working toward consumer centric SEO. This means only optimising websites in ways that will enhance the user’s experience. They can do using content-rich campaigns and techniques that help users find useful information easily .White hat SEO’s should be working in the best interest of everyone the user the site owner AND the search engines. Google is embracing SEO regardless of what this employee says.. Google’s Search Engine Optimization Starter Guide. Developments in webmaster tools also encourage site owners to make changes to their website so that Google can crawl it more efficiently and help it understand what their site is about. SEO’s should be working to help Google in its plight for high quality relevant search results not fighting against it to warp the results for profit. While we disagree that SEO is bad for the internet we do agree however that black hat SEO is bad for the user and everyone in the long run. A good post and interesting discussion here thanks Graham. Business ECommerce Manager at Gift-Library.com. 3:14PM on 8th February 2012. Google are clearly being hypocrites as they have spammed their own results with Google Plus if you look at the reasons why G is so prominent it's down to SEOing to the max. 3:31PM on 8th February 2012. Yes the Top Ten of Google is decreasing in actual SEO real estate. There are now Google Plus results more social networks and to our research 99 of searches have Wikipedia on page one. Surely this encourages corporations down the paid route. 5:22PM on 8th February 2012. If there was no SEO good sites would naturally rise to the top of the rankings because people would link to them. SEOs running link building campaigns skew this data by creating hundreds of links to content which people would otherwise not be interested in reading. Some SEOs resort to posting links on unprotected forums and comment threads. Harm clearly is done in the name of SEO. Editor at Econsultancy. 6:16PM on 8th February 2012. if you have search engines you have SEO. The two are inseparable. The search engines have to decide a method by which sites are ranked highest and website owners and marketers want to figure out how and improve their own rankings. With SEO as Andrew Girdwood calls it you have more user friendly websites which have to create content that is interesting and relevant to the searcher. This benefits the internet. E-Business Consultant at Dan Barker. 10:05PM on 8th February 2012. I think this is a bit of a red herring. In general SEO has always benefited Google they've simply tried to blacken the areas that risked devaluing their algorithm. At the moment they're in the middle of tweaking the rules considerably so that SEO benefits them even further. As one example they're dangling the carrot of traffic for website owners to buy into the Google+/SPYW stuff. In doing so they hope this will help to drag the mainstream across. And of course if that all works out they win twice once for the network element of Google+ once for embedding themselves as a large downstream recipient from natural search. dan. Search Engine Marketing Manager at Visit Wales. 8:35AM on 9th February 2012. This is a curious debate/thread although I agree with Rishi's reasoning. Google Apple Microsoft are run by shareholders and accountants. Data is a valuable resource and to expect a private company to actively support ventures that threaten income streams may be a little short sighted. Facebook by Goldman Sachs is floating soon is it any wonder that Google is looking at giving less away and developing and tightening up its core business of keyword data normalisation of personal records across accounts google+ In a few years time its possible that people will look back at this period and be amazed that you could get free traffic free data and build successful businesses without investing all that heavily. 9:28AM on 9th February 2012. Yeah Google thinks it's bad cause they don't earn money from good natural SEO.. A search engine without natural results is probably their ideal. I imagine the Yellow Pages came up with an idea pre internet to charge consumers for their directories as well as businesses. Co-Founder and Director at Quad London. 12:13PM on 9th February 2012. This is ridiculous. For someone to say that Optimising a website for a Search Engine is bad for the internet would logically imply that there's something wrong with the search engine itself. 2:17PM on 9th February 2012. I presume he's referring to old-style SEO where links are bought or other shady practices are used to push rankings artificially high. That is bad for users. But Authentic Search where quality content is provided on site to match what users are looking for and promoted off site through quality free editorial is clearly very good for users. Managing Director at Mackerel Media. 2:29PM on 9th February 2012. How about this for discussion. Realistically we should in the long term consider any traffic received from Google for free as a gift and plan for what is no doubt coming down the line if you make money from Google traffic expect them to take a cut unless you have done something remarkable to earn it. Were we talking about physical property the discussion would be very different. Were Google a shopping centre with a 90 share of footfall we'd laugh at the idea of letting traders set up stalls and sell for free whilst at the same time charging other tenants for their space. We'd think it hilarious that we could use sometimes dubious techniques to corral shoppers to our stand....perhaps we'd put up barriers and PVC banners outside a paying tenant's shop diverting people. Can you imagine...\"Looking for a Cheap Mobile Phone Come to our cheap mobile phone stand for cheap mobile deals... etc etc. We'd be bent over double at the entreaties from retailers who consider themselves ethical and who claim to provide what customers are looking for yet want to make a profit for themselves without paying rent to the shopping centre regardless of the information they provide to users at the stand or the special free guides the most from your organic eggs\" naturally written by an egg guru' they give away to everyone willing to hand over their mobile phone number or email address. Yet this is the freedom we all expect from Google. Fair. Director at Loudlaunch.com. 6:18PM on 9th February 2012. Thanks for this post that puts it into perspective. Enough with the stereotypes. These comments are fabulous too.. what is bad for the internet is unethical SEO. Love the comparison to property. Aren't we just helping the siteowners be accessible to everyone. Users are not dumb. We regularly find good traffic throughout the pages and users know to research and bypass what does not look authentic and that these are the people SEO is for. Let's keep showing great SEO.

Posted 09 February 2012 12:01pm by dan barker with 10 comments This post highlights a simple useful feature that's crept onto most of the UK's largest e-commerce sites over the last couple of years with no real coverage. promo strip is not new but has slowly caught on to the point it's almost standard for high street retailers yet still fairly rare on smaller sites. It's a very useful addition from both the customer perspective informative without being overbearing and from the brand perspective orientated without being overbearing!. There are 12 examples below including variations on the central idea. Here's an example of the most basic version from Play.com. That's it. A simple strip of key information that appears under the top navigation of a site performing a roughly similar function as a direct mail Johnson Box. Sometimes these promote key selling points of the site or the brand itself other times they highlight current promotions though really they're a nice way to display info that you want visitor to the site to see. Below are 11 more examples of the trend. In each screengrab the promo strip is highlighted in green. There's a theme among the biggest retailers to use the strip for delivery messaging. John Lewis promote their delivery threshold their to collect delivery info along with their famous Knowingly Undersold. Evans follow the trend with Delivery Returns information but also include a call to action to sign up to their email list. Again Topshop opt for the UK Delivery an delivery promo. House of Fraser copycat John Lewis maybe it was the other way round with collection' delivery' and delivery all promoted prominently here. And again Debenhams follows along with Free Delivery store collection and international delivery. Other than the standard delivery over pick up in store' here are a few variations from retailers who've gone a little further. M&S step things up nicely from their competitors showing international and UK delivery info but also highlighting current promotions in an area every site visitor will see. M&S almost always has sales on some areas of the site and this allows the retailer to flag these to everyone who lands on the site. Another retailer showing their delivery and returns info but Boux Avenue is worth a mention as whereas other retailers have lumped the promo strip on top of their existing design Boux have folded it very neatly in with the overall look/theme of the site. Naked's version differs slightly from others. Firstly it's above the navigation. Secondly it introduces some urgency and a deadline with their in the next XX minutes for next day delivery call to action. Penhaligon's fill this area of dead space in its layout with delivery info but also very usefully for a heavily gifted brand promotes its free gift wrapping service here. As with Naked Wines Pen Heaven again focuses on urgency offering same day engraving for orders before a particular time. It also features customer reviews heavily here great for a smaller brand that visitors may not have heard of. Kiddicare is probably the UK's leading baby product website. it also leads the way here with its promo strip. First it beats out all of the standard promos with next day delivery in hour slots. Second it shows off the 365 day return policy. Third Kiddicare offers a price match promise. Taking it far further the retailer has added these strips down either side of the main content. These strips are hidden if you're on a smaller resolution 1024x768. For anyone on a larger monitor they reinforce the price match fast despatch but also show off their many awards and promote their 119\,000 product reviews. As you can see these have popped up all over the place. They're a very simple addition to highlight features or info you want to show off to all of your visitors. If you run an e-commerce site and haven't already tried this it's worth testing. If you're already running this with the bog standard delivery over it's worth trialing some other ideas to see the impact they have. There are some nice extensions to this too personalising them to include discount codes depending on traffic source etc. If you're willing to A/B test it it's probably worth paying more attention to the impact it has on visitors or first time buyers rather than your overall conversion rate. Do leave a comment if you've seen any other interesting examples of this or had any experience yourself around results. Dan Barker is an E-Business Consultant and a guest blogger on Econsultancy.

Great article Dan highlighting something which I have been talking about and presenting ideas on over the last 12 months. The promo strip is a great example of a design pattern which I am seeing users actively engage with during user testing sessions. Your summary of the benefits of this feature is spot on too.. a very useful addition from both the customer perspective informative without being overbearing and from the brand perspective orientated without being overbearing!). Picking up on the Naked Wines example you have provided they have in fact featured this countdown timer since they launched their site and its a superb way to deliver a persuasive technique a sense of urgency to which you can almost guarantee all site visitors will see even if only sub-consciously. A quick recommendation I make to retailers when they are implementing these strips is to not try cramming too many messages in the space. If you compare John Lewis to Pen Heaven or Kiddicare it takes less effort to scan the latter two sites messages along with them using visual elements to help differentiate the messages. Thanks again for a great post. E-Business Consultant at Dan Barker. 12:54PM on 9th February 2012. Thanks Paul And great advice. Interestingly I don't think the Naked Wines design had it from the start. I could be wrong but I think this was their original http://bit.ly/originalnw. I think that makes a nice point too it's really useful to test this kind of thing to find out what works for your site your audience and your business needs. Thanks again. dan. Senior Marketing Manager Personalisation MVT at Tesco.com. 1:19PM on 9th February 2012. Agree on your point that its been quietly bubbling away on many e-com sites without too much focus. Very useful used in the right way. One thing I've not seen is contextualising and personalising this area there are pros and cons associated with this but used correctly you could use profile data on the user first visit categories browsed etc to provide some persuasive prompting e.g. for a first time visitor provide generic deliver/returns/click collect/etc info and start tailoring the message as a visitor moves from first time to a potential customer to becoming a customer etc.. and then within things that fit your brand such as male/female the M&S example simply choosing whether to display the Men's or Women's Trouser Offer. 1:31PM on 9th February 2012. Great article Dan They are fantastic examples of persuading the user without bombarding them with too much information. I couldn't agree more with Paul about the scanning the messages. How adding a bit of colour to break the different messages down alongside more leading text. Another great example of this is ASOS they really are fantastic and persuading through out the customer journey. Ecommerce Director at Eurosimm Ltd. 2:15PM on 9th February 2012. Interesting to see so many retailers using the bar to promote their delivery offerings. Perhaps it's because most of their customers are familiar with their wider propositions so they don't need to push the choose us message. I'd advocate using the bar to push the key USPs for the business particularly for smaller less well known retailers fighting to make their mark. It would be interesting to see eye tracking studies or survey people using sites featuring promo bars to see if the content registers with them or not. Given that the bar is likely to be in their eyeline as they journey through the site I'd wager that it registers subconsciously even if they dont actively read it. Analyst at CxFocus. 3:43PM on 9th February 2012. Very interesting indeed. Thanks Dan. I think it's very good when patterns like these start to emerge. As with top navigation and side navigation email address then password for login as an even more common one it helps if new visitors have some expectation of where some things may be. I agree with Albie that the choose us message is very important too. Not one of these examples does much along those lines. I think they're assuming everyone will recognise them which is no longer a safe bet. But in fact I think a USP message need to be bigger and more prominent than these strips. One question for Paul you mention people engaging with these strips in usability tests. Was that just mentioning them in out loud or actually clicking please I'm reassured either way because all too often I find people manage to miss even prominent messages. But I'm also slightly concerned if someone's first reaction when landing on a site was to click for details on something like this even if it does demonstrate a keen commercial intent. 3:49PM on 9th February 2012. In most instances it was displayed on the main page and as the writer pointed out it can appear on all pages. I believe it could be very useful as it is an upsell on the checkout page. It distracts from the natural flow of the menu and home page flow and would cause most consumers to pause just long enough to wonder why they are there and leave. A more interesting study Albie would be a correlation between eye tracking and conversion rates as while I certainly agree it's a great idea it's the type of distraction that can potentially loose a customer if over used. It would be unusual that something like this would have been incorporated into the original design of the site and as such adding it afterwords without breaking up the natural flow of the original design would be difficult. I think it's an excellent way to drawer additional value to your site but only if used in moderation and where a customer might naturally expect to see it. Very nice article Dan. Cheers Robert. 9:13AM on 10th February 2012. I've done some research around this area and have started to call them confidence banners since they often don't aim to directly convert with a call to action merely instill confidence in the customer making them more likely to make a purchase later on. Analyst at CxFocus. 11:14AM on 10th February 2012. That's interesting Rich. What kind of research did you do Or is that a cheeky question I'm not asking for intrusive detail just the general type of thing. 4:54PM on 10th February 2012. Not at all Tim Mainly the importance and distinction between two types of banners we've come to identify as confidence banners and conversion banners. Also general practice in placement and functionality of each. Conversion banners usually being more prominent on a page and containing a direct call to action.

Print. Posted 09 February 2012 11:42am by Vikki Chowney with 2 comments Domino's Pizza UK Ireland has revealed that 13 of its digital sales come through a tablet or smartphone. These stats were released today as the company also launched a Windows 7 version of its mobile app the seventh channel that's now available for mobile sales. Mobile has proved to be a hugely successful avenue for Domino’s the company’s iPhone app alone has generated over in sales in the past year and now accounts for 4.1 of all online orders. Domino's head of commercial systems Paul Francis says that the brand lends itself brilliantly to mobile retail. 13 of all digital sales come though a tablet or smartphone so we know that for many customers mobile is the preferred way of ordering. We have ambitious plans for 2012 and I am delighted that we can offer this new app for the Windows Phone 7 platform. We look forward to hearing what our customers think.. Whereas Domino’s multimedia manager Nick Dutch highlighted that this new app release built by Vexed Digital is a response to developing consumer trends and staying of the game. With WP7 we see a great opportunity to get into the hands of loyal Nokia fans who will be upgrading as WP7 launches.. Back in September we reviewed Domino’s iPad app which to this day provides a significant advantage for the company over its main rival Pizza Hut which has not done anything with mobile at all the UK at least. Like the iPhone version the iPad app by Somo is well designed and intuitive to use and the larger screen allows it to use high resolution images of its pizzas. The brand also released a second app in the app in the US in November. Named Pizza Hero it’s a game format that times how long it takes for you to virtually top a pizza with points awarded for performance. Once you've passed levels one through five affectionately nicknamed Pizza School other players will get a chance to rate your performance. Players can then of course order a real delivery through the app. Domino's also announced today that it was reviewing its digital and direct marketing account.

Print. Posted 05 January 2012 14:58pm by Graham Charlton with 27 comments We've already asked industry experts about what 2012 holds for search and e-commerce now it's the turn of web analytics. 2011 was a busy year for Google Analytics updates as well as the EU Privacy law and our experts identify the issues to look out for in the next 12 months.. The biggest change by far has been the introduction of the EU Privacy Law that came into effect on 25th May 2011. It wasn't a great surprise as privacy has been bubbling below the surface of our industry for the last five years my post Five Predictions For Web Analytics in 2011) but how this law has been interpreted did shock the web analytics world at least across Europe. Sadly the ICO Independent Commissioner’s Office who in the UK are responsible for providing guidance and enforce this law has taken the view that benign web tracking that is anonymous and aggregate visit data collected by tools such as Google Analytics are not allowed to do so without explicit consent of the visitor. That means you force an ugly and intrusive pop-up window similar notice asking your visitors for consent. The ICO has done this the top banner of their site and seen a drop of 90 in the traffic they are able to measure. Imagine the impact that would have on an e-commerce site 90 of your data suddenly lost. Clearly this is wrong. The focus needs to be on the abusers of online tracking not people following best practice. This will rumble on throughout 2012 for sure.. As a Google Analytics end user 2011 has included a mixture of really annoying things data sampled data missing keywords) and some really innovative things. The GA team has certainly been very busy and it's been hard to keep track of the many new additions they've made to the tool. In just 12 months we've seen the introduction of site speed metrics social media metrics the brilliant multi-channel funnels improved dashboards and reports flow analysis and code improvements to event tracking and the API. Not to mention Google Analytics Premium for those big enough to afford it. The Google Analytics updates have been great. They've updated more this year than in the last few years combined. I think the move toward analysis is really nice and that will only continue. Pulling in different types of data is also really interesting and I'd bet that gets extended much further. From my point of view a really nice trend over the last year is that more of the people I work with have gone from asking do we set up reports?. to can we do with this data?. My dad published a Kindle book this year after having realised there was an audience for it on the basis of his Google Analytics data. It's brilliant to see lots of people actually using all this amazing data that's available. The thing that's going to be on the mind of everyone who operates a site in the EU is the forthcoming cookie legislation which is due to be enforced from May. I'm sure some agencies will gain new business by offering cookie audits policies and tools to obtain permission but I think it remains to be seen how many will even bother to implement anything particularly initially. I think many are likely to see what their competitors do and look at the methods being used to obtain permission as those proposed so far haven't been great. It would be nice if this problem could simply be passed back to the browser developers but I don't think that's going to happen. The analytics tool vendors have also been very quiet on the issue. I'm hoping that it will be possible that we'll be able to avoid prosecution by taking fairly simple measures that don't significantly harm the user experience. I think 2012 could be the year that the long standing issue of integrating offsite metrics with onsite metrics comes of age. The big offsite metrics questions are what people how many are saying about you away from your website i.e. social media. Because this happens offsite and in many disparate systems/networks its measurement and correlation with what happens on your site has so far not been an easy task to achieve. The law mobile and social analytics will be big topics next year. I think multichannel analytics and analytics will start to go mainstream too and that automation based on analytics data will become a bit easier. There's an odd situation in the web analytics market at the moment in that Google Analytics now serves 95 of sites. The big in Google Analytics is that it doesn't let you track personally identifiable information so you can't use it to answer even simple questions like were my biggest customers this year what's bringing them to the website and how often are they visiting?. To get those answers you either have to move to a very niche web analytics tool or pay mid/high five figures. Someone is bound to fix that soon as it's a problem that exists for almost every website and it's weird that the bulk of web analytics is so far away from being customer-centric at the moment. BI web analytics will keep moving closer together and by the end of the year someone will have used the words data on Question Time and the cast of TOWIE will have had a punch up over the merits of NoSQL. I hope that a better understanding of privacy in the eyes of the law solidifies in 2012. Privacy is a big issue for anyone online it is simply too easy at present for this to be abused and a couple of high profile cases could really harm the ability of website owners to collect the benign stuff. Bad practice has to go so in general the new EU Privacy Law is a good thing. Bad practice includes the surreptitious collection of personal identifiable information sharing of visit information with 3rd parties 3rd party cookies and similar techniques and the tracking of visits between different unrelated websites DoubleClick I don't like the fact that you do this. Of course if you have explicit user consent no problem but otherwise it should be a clear no-no. I am just hoping that good practice websites are not going to be caught up with the bad stuff which is happening at present.. As someone heavily involved in analytics implementation new features in the APIs appeal most to me. I'm a big fan of event tracking so the non-interactive event tracking addition was great but some extra custom variables wouldn't go amiss given that Premium users now get 50 compared to the mere five in the free version. A Google Analytics server-side import API would also be nice as would the addition of some additional metrics to improve the quality of reporting. On the interface side the enhancement of the brilliant new reports and dashboards tools with custom calculated metrics would be the icing on the cake. Graham Charlton is Editor at Econsultancy.

Excellent point on the PII bit Dan Maybe we'll see a clarification to the terms of use this year Quite a few people seem to be using the utma cookie visitor ID or the transaction ID are the same as a primary key allowing them to link their GA data to their CRM for offline analysis. However although this is allowed in Premium GA it's apparently not in the free version though I've seen a few people disputing this. If it were allowed it would definitely take things to another level Arguably it's not storing anything else in GA since the ID is the same as the one GA issued itself and it's not really personally identifiable. 4:50PM on 5th January 2012. Some interesting thoughts some of which are mirroring my own. I personally can't see how this EU ruling is enforceable and don't even think it will end up getting to that stage. 12:06AM on 6th January 2012. It would be comforting to believe that Tom Hicks is right and we can ostrich like just carry on regardless with no repercussions but I'm not so sure Just as Matt Clarke highlighted very little seems to have been done to address the issue with very little information available to easily comply and that that has been published like the ICO site itself does not lend itself to a very pleasing customer experience and more likely to annoy than provide confidence. 9:09AM on 6th January 2012. If 95 of analytics is controlled by Google then I'd suggest that it is their job to get a sensible fix sorted out and applied globally. Group Head of Data Intelligence Netbooster at Guava Netbooster. 9:11AM on 6th January 2012. I think the insights here are spot on but I can't help thinking it's a shame we're caught up in the PII discussions when the focus could be on the true innovation what will happen Brian mentions btw. the lines when it becomes possible to mash data up from site data sources for me that's the next big innovation and it'll allow us to become able to understand how the actual audiences behave in both our owned media but also in paid when there's no visit to our owned platforms and earned media. The ability to combine behavioural patterns with social demographics sentiment and customer lifetime values and online will disrupt advertising media and businesses. As Dan says and web analytics will move closer together that's to me a very understated way of saying disruption :-. Happy New Year.. Ewald Head of Data Intelligence Guava/NB Group. Online Director at Specialist Holidays Group TUI Travel. 9:48AM on 6th January 2012. Hmm to my mind you guys aren't thinking big enough here. Nothing here about data Demand side analytics driving supply side pricing merchandising Fusing qual with quant user experience Conversion optimisation etc etc. You need an upgrade : DJ. 10:48AM on 6th January 2012. I see Google Analytics pulling much of its latest services away from the free service in the next 24-36 months. Google is here to make money and once the majority of websites are reliant upon GA to develop their sites then Google will pull many of the most popular services and make them only accessible via Premium GA. Online Marketing Expert Speaker and Trainer at New Terrain Limited. 11:13AM on 6th January 2012. My hope for 2012 echoes Dan's point in that I wish more organisations would start using the data they have. Despite the obvious challenges from the EU organisations already have powerful analytical tools at their disposal. The surprising and often disappointing thing is that the potential for continual change and improvement is rarely seized. Indeed it's often a classic example of the Gap :0. European Web Analytics Specialist at Canon Europe. 11:36AM on 6th January 2012. I'm with David Jarvis on this. Aside from the Cookie situation these guys have failed to identify any serious trends and themes for 2011/2012. I'm afraid talking and complainging about the tools is really not proper analyst thinking. Managing Director at 120 Feet Ltd. 11:54AM on 6th January 2012. Great thoughts and comments. Agree 100 that privacy and tracking will be a big issue in 2012. Though given how slowly and badly many companies coped with previous legislation leads me to agree with MC that many will simply wait and see before making significant changes. I'm looking forward to working with clients and tying the online journey to call centre activity etc to significantly boost ROI and conversion. Also Tag Management should start to make our jobs easier so we can spend more time on planning and analysis and less on the tedious cycle of waiting several months to deploy changes. UK Managing Director at Elisa Interactive Ltd. 12:29PM on 6th January 2012. Interesting that you guys only mention Google Analtyics here. According to the E Consultancy 2012 Web Analytics Buyers guide IBM Adobe and others are kind of a big deal too. GA made some great strides last year more to come but it still has a way to go before it can claim to be the market leader. You can also count on IBM Adobe and Webtrends to keep innovating too making this a very interesting tech space in 2012. For me the biggest challenge in 2012 is not cookie laws. It is the same problem that businesses faced in 2011 2010 2009 etc.. which is actually making use of the data they collect. A study by MIT recently found that only 17 of companies use more than 75 of the data they capture. Most clients we speak to have set their analytics up with little or no customisation and focus on their actual business model. If data is the new oil we are in need of a little refinement as an industry. 5:28PM on 6th January 2012. Is this part of a series...or was I misled by the title Maybe experts with vested interests in Adobe IBM and Webtrends will get their turn next.. UK Managing Director at Elisa Interactive Ltd. 5:35PM on 6th January 2012. Keen to hear your thoughts Rob M on what the 2012 trends will be. Editor at Econsultancy. 5:39PM on 6th January 2012. Yes there are a lot of mentions of GA but this is because it is so popular and the fact that Google has been pretty busy in this area recently. As Dan Barker mentions there is a in GA which means that other analytics tools are required for some customer tracking. We are vendor neutral here but the experts were asked for their opinions on significant analytics trends and this is the result. It is part of an the experts series with other posts on search e-commerce and social media. Google gets a few mentions in those too;. President at Total Value Inc. 6:17PM on 6th January 2012. I'm interested that you haven't talked much about the provided organic keywords that Google is now blocking from searches done while logged into Google accounts. Perhaps this is because you're more UK focussed but here in the US I'm seeing over 30 of keywords now not provided as common. That affects all analytics vendors and the ability to understand visitor behaviour including that within the flaw. Editor at Econsultancy. 6:34PM on 6th January 2012. Hi Philippa I was surprised as well. In fact it was mentioned more in our 2012 search round up http://econsultancy.com/uk/blog/8578-2012-search-predictions-the-experts-view. It is a big issue for us especially as we are targeting the US as well as UK. We've seen the effect on our analytics stats and it's only going to get worse once this changes affects UK search traffic as well. Over the last month 5.4 of our total visits were provided) but when you look at the US traffic it gets worse. For some posts up to 33 of data is encrypted http://econsultancy.com/uk/blog/8263-the-horror-google-now-encrypts-up-to-33-of-search-referral-data. Dan Barker one of the experts quoted here has a workaround for this which at least recovers some of the data http://econsultancy.com/uk/blog/8342-how-to-steal-some-not-provided-data-back-from-google. Hope you find it useful. 11:14AM on 9th January 2012. Amazing to see that some commentators are still putting their heads in the sand about the cookie law. Technically it is not difficult http://www.cookielaw.org. The challenge of the law is to find new ways to get visitors to engage so they will provide consent. I think this will be a good thing for brands in the long run. Managing Director at Lynchpin Analytics. 5:49PM on 9th January 2012. A lot of good debate converging under a analytics banner.. and to be honest I'm not quite sure what belongs under that banner any more so it's a tough gig to do the crystal ball gazing. I suspect the convergence of web analytics and business intelligence hinted at above is much closer than commonly acknowledged. If you go to a BI conference or read a BI forum they will be talking about actually using more of the data collected better visualisations mashing up data from multiple sources predictive analytics big data platforms dynamic pricing etc etc. All of these are important industry trends around managing data and driving business value from it and while the sources might be different I struggle to see much real divergence in the underlying objectives and technologies. So what is left in the mix for web analytics trends 1. 2012 will be the year that we start to look at web analytics as ultimately being Just Another Data Source. The privacy legislation is a key catalyst for this because like it or lump it we now have to at the very least think carefully about exactly what we're capturing and why the resulting quality of that data rather than just stockpiling it and hoping to make sense of it later. And looking at web analytics data in isolation is just not going to cut the mustard anymore. 2. Google does unavoidably make this sector unique there is no Google equivalent in the wider data industry) hence why the Big G keeps coming up in any web analytics commentary. However I think the biggest technology trends in 2012 will at least should be driven by how other vendors respond to the Google Analytics Premium proposition unless Google themselves pull out another significant rabbit from the hat before the end of the year. is the new oil\" finite volatile political polluting. Should be an exciting year anyway Country Manager UK Ireland at AT Internet. 9:05AM on 10th January 2012. To follow on from Rob's comment I should probably point out that although Analytics now serves 95 of sites. that doesn't mean GA is the ONLY web analytics tool being used on those sites. I have worked for 3 of the major paid-for web analytics companies and the majority of the clients at all three use GA in combination with other more sophisticated tools. I'm only trying to show that although GA is ubiquitous these days it doesn't own the market just yet. Managing Director at 120 Feet Ltd. 9:22AM on 10th January 2012. Love the quote from Andrew is the new oil finite volatile political polluting.. European Web Analytics Specialist at Canon Europe. 9:37AM on 10th January 2012. My main themes for 2012 are as follows. All business areas will start to demand direct access to data and insights. As waves of young recruits arrive in existing functions they will demand statistics in a way which previous generations have not. Analysts will be challenged to empower and guide these individuals to ensure responsible analysis and interpretation of statistics. Analytics related tools will continue to plummet in price for two reasons. Firstly Google and its constantly improving free tools. Secondly SMBs are requiring similar capabilities as large enterprises vendors will see the benefit of many smaller clients vs. a few large ones. SEO knowledge will continue to be democratised partly by Google continuing to give us tools and knowledge to undestand it. Analysts will need to be able to cope with first line SEO challenges without recourse to specialists. analytics will grow up and be seen as just another source of BI. We will benefit from not being special and hopefully further distance ourselves from IT. analytics will enjoy being taken to the hearts of functions outside of marketing. It is time for supply chain hr finance etc to become serious stakeholders. My thoughts so far. Country Manager UK Ireland at AT Internet. 11:08AM on 10th January 2012. funny you should mention outside marketing. At AT Internet we have noticed a trend with our enterprise clients where WA is increasingly owned by finance and not marketing. I believe this is a direct reflection of the importance WA data plays in management accounting. With that move in ownership Web Analytics as such will cease to exist and just become another data-point in the larger BI/finance system. 12:56PM on 10th January 2012. You can comply with the law and keep GA analytics unique visitor statistics by only allowing cookies if visitors have agreed. You need a sophisticated client-side solution to do it though e.g. http://cookieconsent.org. This technique also allows you to keep 3rd party content in a compliant way i.e by default no cookies are placed but visitors can give or withdraw their consent at any time. Senior eBusiness Consultant at Capgemini. 6:16PM on 10th January 2012. IBM's CMO report showed that data was a major headache for CMOs. In 2012 I hope to see web analytics tools getting better at coping with other business data. We enjoy superb UI's in the web analytics tools and if that simplicity could be combined with real business insights then we could be on to a winner. SoMoLo Mobile and Local analytics are being heavily touted by Avinash Kaushik and I think this will have a larger part to play in enterprise web analytics. Finally the intelligence offered by web analytics will need to improve as they move from being data and information tools to being truly intelligent. Cookie laws are an unfortunate distraction to innovation at the moment in my opinion. Head of Content Marketing at CIVIC. 12:36PM on 11th January 2012. 2012 will be the year of the return of server-side IP-tracking analytics in the UK. Because most analytics software is cookie-based and an explicit permission will be required the new cookie law for that to work it will be much less useful than hitherto. I hope that Google introduce a cookie-less option and in their script that can look for an explicit opt-in. If their silence continues then we'll have no choice but to introduce another solution either in paralel with Google Analytics or instead of it. Author CEO Web Metrics Strategist at Advanced Web Metrics. 6:55PM on 12th January 2012. Market Share Data --------------- Just to solidify the market share numbers that were banded around tad too loosely in this article. A 2011 study by Stéphane Hamel at Cardinal Path revealed 64 percent of the top 500 U.S. retail sites and 45 percent of Fortune 500 companies use Google Analytics analytics-vendors-market-share. A 2011 survey of 800 businesses percent of them from the UK revealed that 86 percent are using Google for analytics compared to 66 percent just two years ago Measurement and Strategy Report 2011\, Econsultancy.com. A 2010 study by Metric Mail who analyzed the pages of Alexa's Top 1 million domains by searching for the GATC text within pages found Google Analytics had a 50 market share. -analytics-market-share.

Author CEO Web Metrics Strategist at Advanced Web Metrics. 7:11PM on 12th January 2012. Like others that have commented here it is a little disappointing to hear people are focusing on PII as a limiting factor of any web analytics tool. It is by far a small segment of your traffic... Typically customers account for around 3-5 of your web traffic that is being generous. Many many sites languish in the 1-3 bracket. I consider Analytics that is where you have the PII as a separate though obviously related discipline to web analytics. For me Analytics is about exploring the HUGE potential and possibilities of the other 95% of your traffic. I regularly see an enormous amount of money and resource spent on acquiring poor quality traffic. I also often see poorly built websites built around either what good\" work\" and what the is doing. Few people make informed data driven decisions. So focus on the bigger piece of the pie.. Taking an e-commerce conversion rate from 3 to 4 that is taking an anonymous visitor and converting them into a tangible customer often provides an increase in ROI that is orders of magnitude higher than anything that can be achieved with Analytics\"... Consider this According to 2010 data from Forrester Research Inc. profit-indicators-point) the average shopping cart abandonment rate for U.S. online retailers is 55 percent. In other words the transaction revenue obtained by site owners is approximately half that customers are willing to and are in the process of spending. That is on average U.S. retailers leave $1 of the money on the table for every $1 collected It is an incredible amount of money when you consider that U.S. online retail is predicted to be worth $279 billion by 2015 http://techcrunch.com/2011/02/28/forrester-online retail-industry-in-the-us-will-be-worth-279-billion in-2015.

The GA team has certainly been very busy and it's been hard to keep track of the many new additions they've made to the tool. In just 12 months we've seen the introduction of site speed metrics social media metrics the brilliant multi-channel funnels improved dashboards and reports flow analysis and code improvements to event tracking and the API. Not to mention Google Analytics Premium for those big enough to afford it. The Google Analytics updates have been great. They've updated more this year than in the last few years combined. I think the move toward analysis is really nice and that will only continue. Pulling in different types of data is also really interesting and I'd bet that gets extended much further. From my point of view a really nice trend over the last year is that more of the people I work with have gone from asking do we set up reports?. to can we do with this data?. My dad published a Kindle book this year after having realised there was an audience for it on the basis of his Google Analytics data. It's brilliant to see lots of people actually using all this amazing data that's available. The thing that's going to be on the mind of everyone who operates a site in the EU is the forthcoming cookie legislation which is due to be enforced from May. I'm sure some agencies will gain new business by offering cookie audits policies and tools to obtain permission but I think it remains to be seen how many will even bother to implement anything particularly initially. I think many are likely to see what their competitors do and look at the methods being used to obtain permission as those proposed so far haven't been great. It would be nice if this problem could simply be passed back to the browser developers but I don't think that's going to happen. The analytics tool vendors have also been very quiet on the issue. I'm hoping that it will be possible that we'll be able to avoid prosecution by taking fairly simple measures that don't significantly harm the user experience. I think 2012 could be the year that the long standing issue of integrating offsite metrics with onsite metrics comes of age. The big offsite metrics questions are what people how many are saying about you away from your website i.e. social media. Because this happens offsite and in many disparate systems/networks its measurement and correlation with what happens on your site has so far not been an easy task to achieve. The law mobile and social analytics will be big topics next year. I think multichannel analytics and analytics will start to go mainstream too and that automation based on analytics data will become a bit easier. There's an odd situation in the web analytics market at the moment in that Google Analytics now serves 95 of sites. The big in Google Analytics is that it doesn't let you track personally identifiable information so you can't use it to answer even simple questions like were my biggest customers this year what's bringing them to the website and how often are they visiting?. To get those answers you either have to move to a very niche web analytics tool or pay mid/high five figures. Someone is bound to fix that soon as it's a problem that exists for almost every website and it's weird that the bulk of web analytics is so far away from being customer-centric at the moment. BI web analytics will keep moving closer together and by the end of the year someone will have used the words data on Question Time and the cast of TOWIE will have had a punch up over the merits of NoSQL. I hope that a better understanding of privacy in the eyes of the law solidifies in 2012. Privacy is a big issue for anyone online it is simply too easy at present for this to be abused and a couple of high profile cases could really harm the ability of website owners to collect the benign stuff. Bad practice has to go so in general the new EU Privacy Law is a good thing. Bad practice includes the surreptitious collection of personal identifiable information sharing of visit information with 3rd parties 3rd party cookies and similar techniques and the tracking of visits between different unrelated websites DoubleClick I don't like the fact that you do this. Of course if you have explicit user consent no problem but otherwise it should be a clear no-no. I am just hoping that good practice websites are not going to be caught up with the bad stuff which is happening at present.. As someone heavily involved in analytics implementation new features in the APIs appeal most to me. I'm a big fan of event tracking so the non-interactive event tracking addition was great but some extra custom variables wouldn't go amiss given that Premium users now get 50 compared to the mere five in the free version. A Google Analytics server-side import API would also be nice as would the addition of some additional metrics to improve the quality of reporting. On the interface side the enhancement of the brilliant new reports and dashboards tools with custom calculated metrics would be the icing on the cake. Graham Charlton is Editor at Econsultancy.

Excellent point on the PII bit Dan Maybe we'll see a clarification to the terms of use this year Quite a few people seem to be using the utma cookie visitor ID or the transaction ID are the same as a primary key allowing them to link their GA data to their CRM for offline analysis. However although this is allowed in Premium GA it's apparently not in the free version though I've seen a few people disputing this. If it were allowed it would definitely take things to another level Arguably it's not storing anything else in GA since the ID is the same as the one GA issued itself and it's not really personally identifiable. 4:50PM on 5th January 2012. Some interesting thoughts some of which are mirroring my own. I personally can't see how this EU ruling is enforceable and don't even think it will end up getting to that stage. 12:06AM on 6th January 2012. It would be comforting to believe that Tom Hicks is right and we can ostrich like just carry on regardless with no repercussions but I'm not so sure Just as Matt Clarke highlighted very little seems to have been done to address the issue with very little information available to easily comply and that that has been published like the ICO site itself does not lend itself to a very pleasing customer experience and more likely to annoy than provide confidence. 9:09AM on 6th January 2012. If 95 of analytics is controlled by Google then I'd suggest that it is their job to get a sensible fix sorted out and applied globally. Group Head of Data Intelligence Netbooster at Guava Netbooster. 9:11AM on 6th January 2012. I think the insights here are spot on but I can't help thinking it's a shame we're caught up in the PII discussions when the focus could be on the true innovation what will happen Brian mentions btw. the lines when it becomes possible to mash data up from site data sources for me that's the next big innovation and it'll allow us to become able to understand how the actual audiences behave in both our owned media but also in paid when there's no visit to our owned platforms and earned media. The ability to combine behavioural patterns with social demographics sentiment and customer lifetime values and online will disrupt advertising media and businesses. As Dan says and web analytics will move closer together that's to me a very understated way of saying disruption :-. Happy New Year.. Ewald Head of Data Intelligence Guava/NB Group. Online Director at Specialist Holidays Group TUI Travel. 9:48AM on 6th January 2012. Hmm to my mind you guys aren't thinking big enough here. Nothing here about data Demand side analytics driving supply side pricing merchandising Fusing qual with quant user experience Conversion optimisation etc etc. You need an upgrade : DJ. 10:48AM on 6th January 2012. I see Google Analytics pulling much of its latest services away from the free service in the next 24-36 months. Google is here to make money and once the majority of websites are reliant upon GA to develop their sites then Google will pull many of the most popular services and make them only accessible via Premium GA. Online Marketing Expert Speaker and Trainer at New Terrain Limited. 11:13AM on 6th January 2012. My hope for 2012 echoes Dan's point in that I wish more organisations would start using the data they have. Despite the obvious challenges from the EU organisations already have powerful analytical tools at their disposal. The surprising and often disappointing thing is that the potential for continual change and improvement is rarely seized. Indeed it's often a classic example of the Gap :0. European Web Analytics Specialist at Canon Europe. 11:36AM on 6th January 2012. I'm with David Jarvis on this. Aside from the Cookie situation these guys have failed to identify any serious trends and themes for 2011/2012. I'm afraid talking and complainging about the tools is really not proper analyst thinking. Managing Director at 120 Feet Ltd. 11:54AM on 6th January 2012. Great thoughts and comments. Agree 100 that privacy and tracking will be a big issue in 2012. Though given how slowly and badly many companies coped with previous legislation leads me to agree with MC that many will simply wait and see before making significant changes. I'm looking forward to working with clients and tying the online journey to call centre activity etc to significantly boost ROI and conversion. Also Tag Management should start to make our jobs easier so we can spend more time on planning and analysis and less on the tedious cycle of waiting several months to deploy changes. UK Managing Director at Elisa Interactive Ltd. 12:29PM on 6th January 2012. Interesting that you guys only mention Google Analtyics here. According to the E Consultancy 2012 Web Analytics Buyers guide IBM Adobe and others are kind of a big deal too. GA made some great strides last year more to come but it still has a way to go before it can claim to be the market leader. You can also count on IBM Adobe and Webtrends to keep innovating too making this a very interesting tech space in 2012. For me the biggest challenge in 2012 is not cookie laws. It is the same problem that businesses faced in 2011 2010 2009 etc.. which is actually making use of the data they collect. A study by MIT recently found that only 17 of companies use more than 75 of the data they capture. Most clients we speak to have set their analytics up with little or no customisation and focus on their actual business model. If data is the new oil we are in need of a little refinement as an industry. 5:28PM on 6th January 2012. Is this part of a series...or was I misled by the title Maybe experts with vested interests in Adobe IBM and Webtrends will get their turn next.. UK Managing Director at Elisa Interactive Ltd. 5:35PM on 6th January 2012. Keen to hear your thoughts Rob M on what the 2012 trends will be. Editor at Econsultancy. 5:39PM on 6th January 2012. Yes there are a lot of mentions of GA but this is because it is so popular and the fact that Google has been pretty busy in this area recently. As Dan Barker mentions there is a in GA which means that other analytics tools are required for some customer tracking. We are vendor neutral here but the experts were asked for their opinions on significant analytics trends and this is the result. It is part of an the experts series with other posts on search e-commerce and social media. Google gets a few mentions in those too;. President at Total Value Inc. 6:17PM on 6th January 2012. I'm interested that you haven't talked much about the provided organic keywords that Google is now blocking from searches done while logged into Google accounts. Perhaps this is because you're more UK focussed but here in the US I'm seeing over 30 of keywords now not provided as common. That affects all analytics vendors and the ability to understand visitor behaviour including that within the flaw. Editor at Econsultancy. 6:34PM on 6th January 2012. Hi Philippa I was surprised as well. In fact it was mentioned more in our 2012 search round up http://econsultancy.com/uk/blog/8578-2012-search-predictions-the-experts-view. It is a big issue for us especially as we are targeting the US as well as UK. We've seen the effect on our analytics stats and it's only going to get worse once this changes affects UK search traffic as well. Over the last month 5.4 of our total visits were provided) but when you look at the US traffic it gets worse. For some posts up to 33 of data is encrypted http://econsultancy.com/uk/blog/8263-the-horror-google-now-encrypts-up-to-33-of-search-referral-data. Dan Barker one of the experts quoted here has a workaround for this which at least recovers some of the data http://econsultancy.com/uk/blog/8342-how-to-steal-some-not-provided-data-back-from-google. Hope you find it useful. 11:14AM on 9th January 2012. Amazing to see that some commentators are still putting their heads in the sand about the cookie law. Technically it is not difficult http://www.cookielaw.org. The challenge of the law is to find new ways to get visitors to engage so they will provide consent. I think this will be a good thing for brands in the long run. Managing Director at Lynchpin Analytics. 5:49PM on 9th January 2012. A lot of good debate converging under a analytics banner.. and to be honest I'm not quite sure what belongs under that banner any more so it's a tough gig to do the crystal ball gazing. I suspect the convergence of web analytics and business intelligence hinted at above is much closer than commonly acknowledged. If you go to a BI conference or read a BI forum they will be talking about actually using more of the data collected better visualisations mashing up data from multiple sources predictive analytics big data platforms dynamic pricing etc etc. All of these are important industry trends around managing data and driving business value from it and while the sources might be different I struggle to see much real divergence in the underlying objectives and technologies. So what is left in the mix for web analytics trends 1. 2012 will be the year that we start to look at web analytics as ultimately being Just Another Data Source. The privacy legislation is a key catalyst for this because like it or lump it we now have to at the very least think carefully about exactly what we're capturing and why the resulting quality of that data rather than just stockpiling it and hoping to make sense of it later. And looking at web analytics data in isolation is just not going to cut the mustard anymore. 2. Google does unavoidably make this sector unique there is no Google equivalent in the wider data industry) hence why the Big G keeps coming up in any web analytics commentary. However I think the biggest technology trends in 2012 will at least should be driven by how other vendors respond to the Google Analytics Premium proposition unless Google themselves pull out another significant rabbit from the hat before the end of the year. is the new oil\" finite volatile political polluting. Should be an exciting year anyway Country Manager UK Ireland at AT Internet. 9:05AM on 10th January 2012. To follow on from Rob's comment I should probably point out that although Analytics now serves 95 of sites. that doesn't mean GA is the ONLY web analytics tool being used on those sites. I have worked for 3 of the major paid-for web analytics companies and the majority of the clients at all three use GA in combination with other more sophisticated tools. I'm only trying to show that although GA is ubiquitous these days it doesn't own the market just yet. Managing Director at 120 Feet Ltd. 9:22AM on 10th January 2012. Love the quote from Andrew is the new oil finite volatile political polluting.. European Web Analytics Specialist at Canon Europe. 9:37AM on 10th January 2012. My main themes for 2012 are as follows. All business areas will start to demand direct access to data and insights. As waves of young recruits arrive in existing functions they will demand statistics in a way which previous generations have not. Analysts will be challenged to empower and guide these individuals to ensure responsible analysis and interpretation of statistics. Analytics related tools will continue to plummet in price for two reasons. Firstly Google and its constantly improving free tools. Secondly SMBs are requiring similar capabilities as large enterprises vendors will see the benefit of many smaller clients vs. a few large ones. SEO knowledge will continue to be democratised partly by Google continuing to give us tools and knowledge to undestand it. Analysts will need to be able to cope with first line SEO challenges without recourse to specialists. analytics will grow up and be seen as just another source of BI. We will benefit from not being special and hopefully further distance ourselves from IT. analytics will enjoy being taken to the hearts of functions outside of marketing. It is time for supply chain hr finance etc to become serious stakeholders. My thoughts so far. Country Manager UK Ireland at AT Internet. 11:08AM on 10th January 2012. funny you should mention outside marketing. At AT Internet we have noticed a trend with our enterprise clients where WA is increasingly owned by finance and not marketing. I believe this is a direct reflection of the importance WA data plays in management accounting. With that move in ownership Web Analytics as such will cease to exist and just become another data-point in the larger BI/finance system. 12:56PM on 10th January 2012. You can comply with the law and keep GA analytics unique visitor statistics by only allowing cookies if visitors have agreed. You need a sophisticated client-side solution to do it though e.g. http://cookieconsent.org. This technique also allows you to keep 3rd party content in a compliant way i.e by default no cookies are placed but visitors can give or withdraw their consent at any time. Senior eBusiness Consultant at Capgemini. 6:16PM on 10th January 2012. IBM's CMO report showed that data was a major headache for CMOs. In 2012 I hope to see web analytics tools getting better at coping with other business data. We enjoy superb UI's in the web analytics tools and if that simplicity could be combined with real business insights then we could be on to a winner. SoMoLo Mobile and Local analytics are being heavily touted by Avinash Kaushik and I think this will have a larger part to play in enterprise web analytics. Finally the intelligence offered by web analytics will need to improve as they move from being data and information tools to being truly intelligent. Cookie laws are an unfortunate distraction to innovation at the moment in my opinion. Head of Content Marketing at CIVIC. 12:36PM on 11th January 2012. 2012 will be the year of the return of server-side IP-tracking analytics in the UK. Because most analytics software is cookie-based and an explicit permission will be required the new cookie law for that to work it will be much less useful than hitherto. I hope that Google introduce a cookie-less option and in their script that can look for an explicit opt-in. If their silence continues then we'll have no choice but to introduce another solution either in paralel with Google Analytics or instead of it. Author CEO Web Metrics Strategist at Advanced Web Metrics. 6:55PM on 12th January 2012. Market Share Data --------------- Just to solidify the market share numbers that were banded around tad too loosely in this article. A 2011 study by Stéphane Hamel at Cardinal Path revealed 64 percent of the top 500 U.S. retail sites and 45 percent of Fortune 500 companies use Google Analytics analytics-vendors-market-share. A 2011 survey of 800 businesses percent of them from the UK revealed that 86 percent are using Google for analytics compared to 66 percent just two years ago Measurement and Strategy Report 2011\, Econsultancy.com. A 2010 study by Metric Mail who analyzed the pages of Alexa's Top 1 million domains by searching for the GATC text within pages found Google Analytics had a 50 market share. -analytics-market-share. You can find an updated snapshot of major brands using Google Analytics at www.advanced-web-metrics.com/who-uses google-analytics. Author CEO Web Metrics Strategist at Advanced Web Metrics. 7:11PM on 12th January 2012. Like others that have commented here it is a little disappointing to hear people are focusing on PII as a limiting factor of any web analytics tool. It is by far a small segment of your traffic... Typically customers account for around 3-5 of your web traffic that is being generous. Many many sites languish in the 1-3 bracket. I consider Analytics that is where you have the PII as a separate though obviously related discipline to web analytics. For me Analytics is about exploring the HUGE potential and possibilities of the other 95% of your traffic. I regularly see an enormous amount of money and resource spent on acquiring poor quality traffic. I also often see poorly built websites built around either what good\" work\" and what the is doing. Few people make informed data driven decisions. So focus on the bigger piece of the pie.. Taking an e-commerce conversion rate from 3 to 4 that is taking an anonymous visitor and converting them into a tangible customer often provides an increase in ROI that is orders of magnitude higher than anything that can be achieved with Analytics\"... Consider this According to 2010 data from Forrester Research Inc. profit-indicators-point) the average shopping cart abandonment rate for U.S. online retailers is 55 percent. In other words the transaction revenue obtained by site owners is approximately half that customers are willing to and are in the process of spending. That is on average U.S. retailers leave $1 of the money on the table for every $1 collected It is an incredible amount of money when you consider that U.S. online retail is predicted to be worth $279 billion by 2015 http://techcrunch.com/2011/02/28/forrester-online retail-industry-in-the-us-will-be-worth-279-billion in-2015.

Posted 10 February 2012 09:38am by Stephen Croome with 7 comments Google’s Panda update was a direct attack on bad content which comes in many different flavours including duplicate weak thin and template. Panda acts like a domain wide penalty so your whole site is affected and your good pages are dragged down by your bad pages. This is a guide on how to find and fix Google's Panda algorithm update based on our Panda fighting experience at SEOgadget in 2011. Often badly designed Information Architectures compound the problems with already week content. Large sites that have many pages templated content and lots of sub-categories are the most at risk. If you haven’t been monitoring and fixing your accessibility issues as highlighted in Google Webmaster Tools you are at risk. All of these examples are from the UK mostly from the employment and gift sectors. We use Searchmetric's SEO visibility score to find out just when sites got hit or recovered from Panda. There are three dates that stick out in the UK data. You can see in this graph that they are trying to fix their Panda issues but haven’t yet bitten the bullet and made the leap they need to. I know these guys well. They have no idea this data exists or anything about panda but they have done OK. One might argue that they are OK because they couldn’t care less about SEO and have a product that people like. It would be easy to attribute this to Panda but this looks more like developer or general website issues. One of my favourites from the Employment industry which clearly shows winners and losers. I love the green line. Did they even know they had benefited from Google Panda Did they think they had done something to deserve the new traffic. Was it all Champagne cocaine and cash bonuses and then three months later the next panda update smacks them. With Panda thinning out sites in a vertical it creates a false sense of success for the winners as they themselves may be next in line for the chopping block.. The blue line benefits from the first Panda update and then it looks like they get hit by Panda a few months later but I don’t think that’s Panda I think that’s development gone wrong. Panda smacks and recovery are one day to the next not across a number of weeks. Given this graph where would you go to look for examples of sites that are being rewarded by Google Panda. Find the websites that benefitted from Panda and look at their content as that is now the new minimum level of content quality in your industry. This data is for Prezzybox who we worked with. Panda recovery is possible but a lot of unplanned un-budgeted blood sweat tears and money went into that dip and recovering the traffic. The SEO visibility metric is a proprietary metric but I asked Steve Overton from Searchmetrics if he could give us some more insight into it and he has explained the algorithm behind it. Panda is confusing if you are not on top of your data and industry news. There were so many updates it becomes easy to blame everything bad on Panda. Conversely there are sites which benefitted from Panda but did not attribute it. When we started exploring how to fix Panda we moved quite conservatively. Now we suggest that people take strong decisive action in resolving issues. Google Panda doesn’t fix itself you have to fix it. It will take time money and effort. It also requires a change in how you see your online business. You can make this whole process a lot easier on your business if you put a person in charge of content and give them a budget and developer time. The advice is quite simple concentrated around a few key areas. The implementation is where companies fall down. Fixing Panda is not complex but it does require a lot of work. Give someone the responsibility to hunt down duplicate content. Use Google Webmaster tools or SEOmoz tools or Xenu or an IIS crawl whatever people suggest in the blog comments. It’s not tough to do it just requires some concentrated effort. Solve duplicate content issues with rel=canonical. Here are seven short videos of Google’s Matt Cutts talking about different aspects of implementing rel=canonical. If you have a section that is just thin templated content it is hurting the good contents ability to rank. Be strong and cut the crap or add to your content to improve it. Cutting the crap. 404 a bad section or area and after the pages have dropped out of the index 301 them somewhere good so you don’t lose any incoming link juice. This is potentially the biggest win. SEOmoz has a good guide to 301s including links to references for 301s under Apache and IIS. Making your content great. There is no getting around the fact that time and effort is needed here. Someone in your organisation needs the time and responsibility to sit down and create great content or manage the creation process via third party writers. I believe that great content requires both qualitative and quantitative research and a knowledgably person to knit it together to suit both users and search engines. Here is my guide on taking mediocre content and making it great content and an overview from our work on Panda on how Google might interpret content quality signals. Templated content. Write content hire interns or find people in cheaper parts of the world. Many companies are unnecessarily precious about their content and ultimately this ends up hurting more than helping them. Elance Odesk and Copify all work for building out content. you now have a person responsible for content quality who will oversee this. Accessibility issues. Run an IIS crawl to find your accessibility issues is easier to use than you think. Here is an example list of errors from an IIS crawl. This becomes your plan of attack for clearing up accessibility issues. You will end up with a list of issues and the urls where those issues are occurring to be able to go and fix them. The world is not as it once was. Crap websites trying to masquerade as decent websites are being hunted down and sunk below the quality line. Google owes you nothing. Tactics to just barely raise your quality enough to recover your rankings are unlikely to pay dividends. You may well find yourself a loser again the next time the quality bar is raised. Google is judging you. Google is going to continue to raise the quality bar with future updates. When your competitors improve their websites you will be weakest and in line for the chop at the next quality update. credit tanakawho via Flickr.

Good Post this was some very interesting reading I agree with crap its hard to accept but it is a must. 11:19AM on 10th February 2012. Believe it or not the impact of Panda on my client's websites was minimal if any. I've always stuck the basics of SEO and continue to do so. Good unique and worthy content that is what makes a website successful oh yeah and links. And I believe this article highlights all that. SEO and content strategy consultant German-speaking at My own company. 1:41PM on 10th February 2012. I preach this message a lot but it's always really useful to have what you're saying endorsed by experts out there. Thank you. Marketing Executive at The Slice. 1:42PM on 10th February 2012. badly designed Information Architectures compound the problems with already week content Apparently easily done. 2:54PM on 10th February 2012. The panda update was a reminder that quality beats quantity every time. I'd caution against hiring an intern or a foreign writer to handle your content. It may be cheap but you get what you pay for. Founder at Alpha Content. 3:05PM on 10th February 2012. You may be right that companies are unnecessarily precious about their content' but I'm not sure that's the real problem. I'd say that they're precious about the wrong things. Companies should be precious demanding insistent on really good content. But that's content that's absolutely right for their customer. It's not stuff that makes the board feel good. Head of SEO Operations at SEOGadget. 5:05PM on 10th February 2012. Thanks for the comments I really appreciate them. Nick I agree you need to be careful and there should be someone on the client side who checks the content as part of the content delivery process. Joanna Yup Im with you there reducing decisions based on ego and increasing the ones based on data would help a lot of people who have fallen foul of Panda. S.

Often badly designed Information Architectures compound the problems with already week content. Large sites that have many pages templated content and lots of sub-categories are the most at risk. If you haven’t been monitoring and fixing your accessibility issues as highlighted in Google Webmaster Tools you are at risk. All of these examples are from the UK mostly from the employment and gift sectors. We use Searchmetric's SEO visibility score to find out just when sites got hit or recovered from Panda. There are three dates that stick out in the UK data. You can see in this graph that they are trying to fix their Panda issues but haven’t yet bitten the bullet and made the leap they need to. I know these guys well. They have no idea this data exists or anything about panda but they have done OK. One might argue that they are OK because they couldn’t care less about SEO and have a product that people like. It would be easy to attribute this to Panda but this looks more like developer or general website issues. One of my favourites from the Employment industry which clearly shows winners and losers. I love the green line. Did they even know they had benefited from Google Panda Did they think they had done something to deserve the new traffic. Was it all Champagne cocaine and cash bonuses and then three months later the next panda update smacks them. With Panda thinning out sites in a vertical it creates a false sense of success for the winners as they themselves may be next in line for the chopping block.. The blue line benefits from the first Panda update and then it looks like they get hit by Panda a few months later but I don’t think that’s Panda I think that’s development gone wrong. Panda smacks and recovery are one day to the next not across a number of weeks. Given this graph where would you go to look for examples of sites that are being rewarded by Google Panda. Find the websites that benefitted from Panda and look at their content as that is now the new minimum level of content quality in your industry. This data is for Prezzybox who we worked with. Panda recovery is possible but a lot of unplanned un-budgeted blood sweat tears and money went into that dip and recovering the traffic. The SEO visibility metric is a proprietary metric but I asked Steve Overton from Searchmetrics if he could give us some more insight into it and he has explained the algorithm behind it. Panda is confusing if you are not on top of your data and industry news. There were so many updates it becomes easy to blame everything bad on Panda. Conversely there are sites which benefitted from Panda but did not attribute it. When we started exploring how to fix Panda we moved quite conservatively. Now we suggest that people take strong decisive action in resolving issues. Google Panda doesn’t fix itself you have to fix it. It will take time money and effort. It also requires a change in how you see your online business. You can make this whole process a lot easier on your business if you put a person in charge of content and give them a budget and developer time. The advice is quite simple concentrated around a few key areas. The implementation is where companies fall down. Fixing Panda is not complex but it does require a lot of work. Give someone the responsibility to hunt down duplicate content. Use Google Webmaster tools or SEOmoz tools or Xenu or an IIS crawl whatever people suggest in the blog comments. It’s not tough to do it just requires some concentrated effort. Solve duplicate content issues with rel=canonical. Here are seven short videos of Google’s Matt Cutts talking about different aspects of implementing rel=canonical. If you have a section that is just thin templated content it is hurting the good contents ability to rank. Be strong and cut the crap or add to your content to improve it. Cutting the crap. 404 a bad section or area and after the pages have dropped out of the index 301 them somewhere good so you don’t lose any incoming link juice. This is potentially the biggest win. SEOmoz has a good guide to 301s including links to references for 301s under Apache and IIS. Making your content great. There is no getting around the fact that time and effort is needed here. Someone in your organisation needs the time and responsibility to sit down and create great content or manage the creation process via third party writers. I believe that great content requires both qualitative and quantitative research and a knowledgably person to knit it together to suit both users and search engines. Here is my guide on taking mediocre content and making it great content and an overview from our work on Panda on how Google might interpret content quality signals. Templated content. Write content hire interns or find people in cheaper parts of the world. Many companies are unnecessarily precious about their content and ultimately this ends up hurting more than helping them. Elance Odesk and Copify all work for building out content. you now have a person responsible for content quality who will oversee this. Accessibility issues. Run an IIS crawl to find your accessibility issues is easier to use than you think. Here is an example list of errors from an IIS crawl. This becomes your plan of attack for clearing up accessibility issues. You will end up with a list of issues and the urls where those issues are occurring to be able to go and fix them. The world is not as it once was. Crap websites trying to masquerade as decent websites are being hunted down and sunk below the quality line. Google owes you nothing. Tactics to just barely raise your quality enough to recover your rankings are unlikely to pay dividends. You may well find yourself a loser again the next time the quality bar is raised. Google is judging you. Google is going to continue to raise the quality bar with future updates. When your competitors improve their websites you will be weakest and in line for the chop at the next quality update. credit tanakawho via Flickr.

Good Post this was some very interesting reading I agree with crap its hard to accept but it is a must. 11:19AM on 10th February 2012. Believe it or not the impact of Panda on my client's websites was minimal if any. I've always stuck the basics of SEO and continue to do so. Good unique and worthy content that is what makes a website successful oh yeah and links. And I believe this article highlights all that. SEO and content strategy consultant German-speaking at My own company. 1:41PM on 10th February 2012. I preach this message a lot but it's always really useful to have what you're saying endorsed by experts out there. Thank you.

The panda update was a reminder that quality beats quantity every time. I'd caution against hiring an intern or a foreign writer to handle your content. It may be cheap but you get what you pay for. Founder at Alpha Content. 3:05PM on 10th February 2012. You may be right that companies are unnecessarily precious about their content' but I'm not sure that's the real problem. I'd say that they're precious about the wrong things. Companies should be precious demanding insistent on really good content. But that's content that's absolutely right for their customer. It's not stuff that makes the board feel good. Head of SEO Operations at SEOGadget. 5:05PM on 10th February 2012. Thanks for the comments I really appreciate them. Nick I agree you need to be careful and there should be someone on the client side who checks the content as part of the content delivery process. Joanna Yup Im with you there reducing decisions based on ego and increasing the ones based on data would help a lot of people who have fallen foul of Panda. S.

Posted 01 February 2012 18:41pm by Ben Staveley with 7 comments With the introduction of payment via mobile and a new and updated app is this a new mobile era for Starbucks What opportunities are there for other retailers to follow suit. I love Starbucks and am a regular down at my local Starbucks(s the plural. I was very impressed to see this month that the company has embraced mobile technology throughout its stores with gusto. As the New Year rolled in Starbucks rolled out a new app which allowed people to register their Starbucks card and then with some new mobile scanners installed pay in-store with their mobile phones. Starbucks has clearly decided that mobile is the way forward with what must have been a large infrastructure investment although it has decided not to bother with near field communication as yet. Whether this is because a large number of their customers are IOS users which doesn’t currently have this built in time will tell. Already one in five of Starbucks customers pay for their purchases using their reward card enticed by the offers of free Wi-Fi and a free drink as a reward for 15 in-store visits. With this new app my debit card is linked to my reward card which is linked to my phone so when I am in desperate need of a coffee or a calming half hour in Starbucks all I need is my phone which I’m never without. Why would I now pay for my Starbucks any other way The additional data capture possibilities for Starbucks are endless.. Data such as favourite drinks date of birth. Frequently visited stores and number of visits. Purchase trends and segmented customers. Dynamic offers promotions and communications. I’m sure mobile will be a success for Starbucks and will pave the way for more retailers to invest in mobile technologies which ultimately make purchasing easier for customers. But what could this mean for other retailers both on our streets and off Here’s just some of our more immediate predictions. Starbucks has really set the mobile commerce bar high for 2012. My prediction This is the year that retailers and the public will embrace mobile for mutual satisfaction. Ben Staveley is Head of E-commerce at dotCommerce and a guest blogger on Econsultancy. This 100 slide presentation delivered at an Econsultancy trends briefing covers m-commerce and associated innovation trends and strategies. With the rise in usage of smart devices and the inevitable excitement with the latest tablet playthings this presentation is packed with cutting edge examples marketers can use to understand the relevance of m-commerce to their business.

One weird thing is that they snail-mail you the bonus drink voucher gold status you get a free beverage every 15 stars) which flys in the face of the instantness of the app. VP Marketing at Mobify. 7:43PM on 1st February 2012. Starbucks are clearly a leader in understanding how their customers use mobile then incorporating that understanding into the digital experiences they provide. Working with them on their mobile web experience it was clear they had invested in the people and practices to learn and build fast. Very few other companies are keeping up and pushing technologies like responsive design and the Mobify Platform with as much innovation. Starbucks are leading and extending that lead. 8:12AM on 2nd February 2012. would I now pay for my Starbucks any other way?. Because it's clunky and slow and the staff don't always understand how to use it.. Probably being slightly unfair but I switched back to using the card after a couple of attempts with the app because the app takes so long to process the transaction. When it doesn't work properly Starbucks staff tend to be unsure of what to do. The key thing here is while the idea is great the systems integration and training has to be equally good to make sure it's a viable way to pay. Director at Purple Spinnaker. 8:59AM on 2nd February 2012. Starbucks are leading the way in creating mobile and social strategies which listen to and respond to their customers through creating new products and experiences which are in line with their customers feedback. In 2010 Starbucks customers loaded US$1.7bn onto their pre-pay reward cards and if you look at Starbucks operating margin of 13% you could look at this as their customers provided a cash injection of US$220m to be used for growth projects innovation and new product development. Add to cash injection a more indepth understanding of the starbucks customer through their mobile buying behaviour their social insights and listening strategies their branded social prescence on facebook and twitter and their internal customer idea community mystarbucksidea they have created a trusted relationship which provides the opportunity to work in partnership with their customers to grow their organisation. Having recognised the benefits of operating in this way the Starbucks Senior Management Team are adapting their business to become more responsive to the customers and to deliver new experiences with their customers permission and inclusion which in turn makes it easy for both starbucks and their customers to develop a partnership for growing the organisation. Social and mobile are great engagement vehicles which can support overall business goals and as more organisations learn about the value of integrated strategies beyond the tactile projects more great examples will evolve. Chief Strategy Officer at Mobileize. 3:59PM on 2nd February 2012. An app such as this is clearly great for Starbucks fans but many high street brands face the problem that not everyone has their app or necessarily wants it. The real opportunity around mobile from a business perspective is to reach and convert the customers that aren’t aware of or currently using your brand the upside potential of doing that is going to be many times larger than preaching to the converted. This is the limitation for most app based strategies however well executed they might be. Operations Director at Emailvision. 8:54PM on 2nd February 2012. I would really like to try this but Android version is not available in the UK as far as I can tell. Whilst Starbucks are being very forward thinking with mobile apps and payment fully integrated they are missing the boat when it comes to their emails. Not at all well considered for mobile viewing. comms manager at nestlÃ sa. 10:08AM on 6th February 2012. What's the fuss about Sbucks The Swiss railways have had all this and more for a while. Not only can you buy on-line but the app updates with information on the route you have bought a ticket for as you travel. I would say that the SBB railways is clearly a leader etc etc etc but since they are not American they are ignored. Copyright 2012 E-consultancy.com Limited. All rights reserved.

Compare that to research by MarketTools at the end of 2011 which shows only 23 of US companies provide customer service via Facebook and 12 provide support via Twitter. This highlights the continued divide between what customers are expecting and companies are giving. Brand reputation and promotions still tops the list of how brands are using social media. The good news is once companies begin to engage in this arena the more they find the importance in engaging in social channels. The stats compiled by Zendesk aren't surprising on their own.

Especially for small business owners it is extremely challenging finding the time to manage your brand online like responding to and managing negative comments and/or unhappy customers. While that is critical the bottom line is that focusing on delivering a consistent and delightful customer experience is still paramount--Small businesses that are successful in doing that generally find that their most loyal customers will in fact often advocate for their businesses in social media forums--Or at least the positive comments and reviews will far outpace any negative ones.

Posted 08 February 2012 11:49am by Graham Charlton with 20 comments Aaron Wall recently reported on a Google employee who left comments on Hacker News to the effect that SEO is bad for the internet. The Google employee Googley Jon Rockway said that isn't good for users or the internet at large. It's a surprising statement for a Google employee to make and I've been asking some SEO experts about their views on the issue and whether this reflects the search giant's real views. Instead of being able to SEO the entire Internet businesses can now only affect the search results for a tiny percentage of users. That's a good thing because SEO can't scale and SEO isn't good for users or the Internet at large. If you look at the Google experience from the standpoint of customers it's pretty good. Users get relevant search results and ads. Advertisers get their content on top of everything else. It's a good compromise between advertising and usability and it works really well. It's a bug that you could rank highly in Google without buying ads and Google is trying to fix the bug. Manipulating Google results shouldn't be something you feel entitled to be able to do. If you want to rank highly in Google be relevant for the user currently searching. Engage him in social media or email provide relevant information about what you're selling and generally be a match for what the user wants. Search consultant Rishi Lakhani feels that Rockway has by revealing what could be a very much internal sentiment by Google on their stance on free traffic. It kind of reminds me of an old SEO joke What is the Meaning of SPAM Search Positions Above Mine. However in Google’s view SPAM could mean Search Positions Avoid Moneymaking. Essentially what is Google’s money making model Selling Ads. Every bit of free traffic that a site receives from organic search is a loss in revenue to Google. So are you surprised at this stance I am not. Andrew Girdwood Bigmouthmedia I have a lot of sympathy for Rockway’s comment. SEO that attempts to manipulate Google’s Bing’s search results so that less relevant results are returned above more relevant results is not good for users or the internet. I don’t believe there is a single any more. Some of the SEO throwbacks and perhaps some of the new strands do fall into the helpful category. Spam for example is not helpful. Yes there are plenty of spammers out there but good SEO has benefits for businesses and web users. Here are just a few of those. As Site Visibility's Kelvin Newman points out many improvements to website usability have been made in order to optimise for search engines There’s lots of annoying aspects of websites that SEO has had a role killing off I think the good Karma for SEO ending the trend of splash pages is enough to see the industry through a decade of bad behaviour. Elizabeth Ayers from iCrossing echoes this sentiment If large quality brands did not optimise their sites for search then it is likely that the web would be a poorer place. The web and social would not be as advanced as it is today if SEO hadn’t been such a key revenue driver for brands to take advantage of and participate in creating quality content and participating on social platforms. Content is key to great SEO and cheap tactics like keyword stuffing just don't cut it any more. Instead creating content that people want to read and share is what works best. Andrew Girdwood. Modern SEO is helpful. It is less an advertising tactic and more a marketing strategy. Modern SEO involves creating and working with engaging content content so good that users want to share and discuss it. This is a boon for users and the net as it creates an upwards pressure on quality. Rishi Lakhani. Competitive SEO actually helps make businesses even more relevant to searchers. Because we know who links naturally and why. A page full of carburettors for sale may not get links what is the motivation But a page that shows how to clean your carburettor will. The difference between intent and motivation differs and it’s the SEO community that is hard at work encouraging such content. SEO is not bad for the user but for Google’s pockets. There are businesses spending big bucks on SEO and paid search but by using solid SEO techniques creating a usable site and filling it with great content small businesses can rank higher than bigger rivals. Andrew Girdwood. A strong example of how Modern SEO is great for users in general is in the emergence of social CRM. Businesses are increasing their efforts to look after customers online using platforms like Twitter and Google to reach out to people who have had a bad experience with a brand or encountered some other problem. This is in part due to the rise of social but this is also an example of Modern SEO. Google blogged back in 2010 that being bad to your customers is bad for business. Customers benefit whenever brands take extra effort to look after them and the convergence of search and social have given business extra incentive to do just that. Is this the real subtext of this statement gaff or not As Rockway says thanks to recent changes such as Plus' the amount of Google homepage real estate which is open to influence by SEO is shrinking. So is Google seeking to minimise the role of the SEO Rishi Lakhani feels strongly about this. Of course there are bad approaches to SEO. However this attitude that SEO=SPAM should stop. Because the biggest violators are Google themselves. It takes content from third party sites and slowly wraps it up with ads. Google gets into short term partnerships with businesses with an edge learn their processes use those to build up their own offering and then terminate those relationships. Up to a few years ago Google used to use Yell to supply local content. Now it’s overtaken by Google Local. For years Google has been taking money from credit card companies and comparison sites alike. Now it has launched its own version which it uses Adwords to push.

I would like to share a post I wrote in Feb. 2011 on Good SEO Contributes To The Larger Objectives Of The Web Ecosystem. http://blog.webpro.in/2011/02/how-good-seo-contributes-to-larger.html. A good co-incident that this kind of discussion has come up in Feb. again this year.. 12:49PM on 8th February 2012. Great article that poses a good question As an SEO I get this question quite often. The article really touched on some good points. One in particular in that SEO is not bad for the internet but actually is good in that it improves usability of the web. 1:14PM on 8th February 2012. Optimisation of social based algorithms as Edgerank have consequences even worse than what SEO's have added or taken away from search based algorithm optimisations. Social networks rely on recommendation algorithms that can be gamed. The worst part of a social recommendation algorithm is the potential to create an eventual affect where users become hugely small-minded and less about more' more and ceasing to ask more. To know more about the bubble affect watch this lecture.. http://www.ted.com/talks/eli_pariser_beware_online_filter_bubbles.html. Senior Marketing Manager Personalisation MVT at Tesco.com. 1:16PM on 8th February 2012. This hits it on the nail for me bit of free traffic that a site receives from organic search is a loss in revenue to Google.. There seems to have been a very different stance to running Google with Larry Page as CEO which I'm not convinced will endear users to Google. The don't be evil tool is a great example of how Google have changed as a company as the tool states the relevancy of results is still as good as ever however there's a different commercial agenda at Google now Google are entitled to run Google how they think it should be run but with any long standing the core values are built up through trust and awareness over time. Trust is being eroded away and what was once a fairly clear set of core values seems murky. It does sound like internal sentiment as to what Google thinks of SEO but good SEO improves the quality of what Google returns. Its a WIN:WIN for both Google and SEOs one cannot work without the other especially since the Google rely on proper website structure which the majority of SEOs have helped develop over the last decade. This article still rings true for the 2 areas where google may slip-up quality of results and overdoing the social drive http://www.zdnet.com/blog/btl/new-google-ceo-larry-page-here-are-your-top-two-priorities/46912. CTO at EXPANSYS plc. 1:19PM on 8th February 2012. It certainly encourages index optimisation considerations over real-world usability and cars all built using a windtunnel results in homogeneous looking sites for any sector. 1:21PM on 8th February 2012. you want to rank highly in Google be relevant for the user currently searching. Erm that's called SEO. Granted there are many flavours of SEO some more oily than others but for many organisations SEO is an essential part of running a business online. The goals of SEO should simply be to improve editorial and technical quality to mention competitiveness which results in a better UX all round. Without SEOs who helps raise the editorial bar journalists still neglect copy that they believe is invisible) who ensures that slavishly produced content is optimised to the people that are looking for it most who checks for damaging site errors often people who should have clocked them have not who ensures pages are coded to proper standards so that they are discoverable in search. While you could nominate other company roles to all of the above truth is most of the time they're just cleaning up someone else's mess. So really SEO done the right way is about improving the web not ruining it. Owner at Digital Juggler. 1:45PM on 8th February 2012. Hi Graham I think this is a timely article. SEO is not inherently bad diluting quality is. Some of what Rockway said is bang on the money you want to rank highly in Google be relevant for the user currently searching. However he positions his opinion poorly. Positive SEO is about being relevant if you're not relevant you'll just get poor metrics and people won't come back. I think Rishi's last comment is quite interesting Google taking 3rd party content and wrapping it with ads. It's all about the money to them I don't believe anymore that the focus is on the user. The focus is on driving revenue and they have to think about the user to achieve that. SEO is an innate thing it can't be bad it's the people behind it that are choosing whether or not to follow good or bad practice. So let's focus praise and criticism on the people doing not a marketing discipline. thanks james. 2:01PM on 8th February 2012. 1stly clever bait article guys. 2ndly. SEO is not spam. Matt Cutts already said so. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BS75vhGO-kk&feature=player_embedded. 3rdly how can seo that encourages good web practices such as having a stable and sound site architecture encouraging good content and userbility helping a website serve the most relevant page possible to a searcher be a bad thing. and lastly this guy has probably just revealed the most damnning evidence of what every seo knew all along seo profiling and delberate penalization of sites that do not rely on google ads. any wonder why affiliate and ecommerce sites were the biggest sites to be hit by panda what about the keyword provided crap cmon people. i hope the investigitons into google's competition laws get wind of this. 2:06PM on 8th February 2012. I feel this Googler slipped up on his choice of wording about SEO. His opinion harks back to the stigma associated with SEO of 5 years ago.. back then SEO was regarded as trying to outsmart Google by looking for loopholes. People did exploit these methods until they were closed off but sites that were ranking falsely genuinely didn’t add to the user experience. Many of these websites were affiliate sites or sites littered with adverts. SEO’s should be working toward consumer centric SEO. This means only optimising websites in ways that will enhance the user’s experience. They can do using content-rich campaigns and techniques that help users find useful information easily .White hat SEO’s should be working in the best interest of everyone the user the site owner AND the search engines. Google is embracing SEO regardless of what this employee says.. Google’s Search Engine Optimization Starter Guide. Developments in webmaster tools also encourage site owners to make changes to their website so that Google can crawl it more efficiently and help it understand what their site is about. SEO’s should be working to help Google in its plight for high quality relevant search results not fighting against it to warp the results for profit. While we disagree that SEO is bad for the internet we do agree however that black hat SEO is bad for the user and everyone in the long run. A good post and interesting discussion here thanks Graham. Business ECommerce Manager at Gift-Library.com. 3:14PM on 8th February 2012. Google are clearly being hypocrites as they have spammed their own results with Google Plus if you look at the reasons why G is so prominent it's down to SEOing to the max. 3:31PM on 8th February 2012. Yes the Top Ten of Google is decreasing in actual SEO real estate. There are now Google Plus results more social networks and to our research 99 of searches have Wikipedia on page one. Surely this encourages corporations down the paid route. 5:22PM on 8th February 2012. If there was no SEO good sites would naturally rise to the top of the rankings because people would link to them. SEOs running link building campaigns skew this data by creating hundreds of links to content which people would otherwise not be interested in reading. Some SEOs resort to posting links on unprotected forums and comment threads. Harm clearly is done in the name of SEO. Editor at Econsultancy. 6:16PM on 8th February 2012. if you have search engines you have SEO. The two are inseparable. The search engines have to decide a method by which sites are ranked highest and website owners and marketers want to figure out how and improve their own rankings. With SEO as Andrew Girdwood calls it you have more user friendly websites which have to create content that is interesting and relevant to the searcher. This benefits the internet. E-Business Consultant at Dan Barker. 10:05PM on 8th February 2012. I think this is a bit of a red herring. In general SEO has always benefited Google they've simply tried to blacken the areas that risked devaluing their algorithm. At the moment they're in the middle of tweaking the rules considerably so that SEO benefits them even further. As one example they're dangling the carrot of traffic for website owners to buy into the Google+/SPYW stuff. In doing so they hope this will help to drag the mainstream across. And of course if that all works out they win twice once for the network element of Google+ once for embedding themselves as a large downstream recipient from natural search. dan. Search Engine Marketing Manager at Visit Wales. 8:35AM on 9th February 2012. This is a curious debate/thread although I agree with Rishi's reasoning. Google Apple Microsoft are run by shareholders and accountants. Data is a valuable resource and to expect a private company to actively support ventures that threaten income streams may be a little short sighted. Facebook by Goldman Sachs is floating soon is it any wonder that Google is looking at giving less away and developing and tightening up its core business of keyword data normalisation of personal records across accounts google+ In a few years time its possible that people will look back at this period and be amazed that you could get free traffic free data and build successful businesses without investing all that heavily. 9:28AM on 9th February 2012. Yeah Google thinks it's bad cause they don't earn money from good natural SEO.. A search engine without natural results is probably their ideal. I imagine the Yellow Pages came up with an idea pre internet to charge consumers for their directories as well as businesses. Co-Founder and Director at Quad London. 12:13PM on 9th February 2012. This is ridiculous. For someone to say that Optimising a website for a Search Engine is bad for the internet would logically imply that there's something wrong with the search engine itself. 2:17PM on 9th February 2012. I presume he's referring to old-style SEO where links are bought or other shady practices are used to push rankings artificially high. That is bad for users. But Authentic Search where quality content is provided on site to match what users are looking for and promoted off site through quality free editorial is clearly very good for users. Managing Director at Mackerel Media. 2:29PM on 9th February 2012. How about this for discussion. Realistically we should in the long term consider any traffic received from Google for free as a gift and plan for what is no doubt coming down the line if you make money from Google traffic expect them to take a cut unless you have done something remarkable to earn it. Were we talking about physical property the discussion would be very different. Were Google a shopping centre with a 90 share of footfall we'd laugh at the idea of letting traders set up stalls and sell for free whilst at the same time charging other tenants for their space. We'd think it hilarious that we could use sometimes dubious techniques to corral shoppers to our stand....perhaps we'd put up barriers and PVC banners outside a paying tenant's shop diverting people. Can you imagine...\"Looking for a Cheap Mobile Phone Come to our cheap mobile phone stand for cheap mobile deals... etc etc. We'd be bent over double at the entreaties from retailers who consider themselves ethical and who claim to provide what customers are looking for yet want to make a profit for themselves without paying rent to the shopping centre regardless of the information they provide to users at the stand or the special free guides the most from your organic eggs\" naturally written by an egg guru' they give away to everyone willing to hand over their mobile phone number or email address. Yet this is the freedom we all expect from Google. Fair. Director at Loudlaunch.com. 6:18PM on 9th February 2012. Thanks for this post that puts it into perspective. Enough with the stereotypes. These comments are fabulous too.. what is bad for the internet is unethical SEO. Love the comparison to property. Aren't we just helping the siteowners be accessible to everyone. Users are not dumb. We regularly find good traffic throughout the pages and users know to research and bypass what does not look authentic and that these are the people SEO is for. Let's keep showing great SEO.

Posted 09 February 2012 12:01pm by dan barker with 10 comments This post highlights a simple useful feature that's crept onto most of the UK's largest e-commerce sites over the last couple of years with no real coverage. promo strip is not new but has slowly caught on to the point it's almost standard for high street retailers yet still fairly rare on smaller sites. It's a very useful addition from both the customer perspective informative without being overbearing and from the brand perspective orientated without being overbearing!. There are 12 examples below including variations on the central idea. Here's an example of the most basic version from Play.com. That's it. A simple strip of key information that appears under the top navigation of a site performing a roughly similar function as a direct mail Johnson Box. Sometimes these promote key selling points of the site or the brand itself other times they highlight current promotions though really they're a nice way to display info that you want visitor to the site to see. Below are 11 more examples of the trend. In each screengrab the promo strip is highlighted in green. There's a theme among the biggest retailers to use the strip for delivery messaging. John Lewis promote their delivery threshold their to collect delivery info along with their famous Knowingly Undersold. Evans follow the trend with Delivery Returns information but also include a call to action to sign up to their email list. Again Topshop opt for the UK Delivery an delivery promo. House of Fraser copycat John Lewis maybe it was the other way round with collection' delivery' and delivery all promoted prominently here. And again Debenhams follows along with Free Delivery store collection and international delivery. Other than the standard delivery over pick up in store' here are a few variations from retailers who've gone a little further. M&S step things up nicely from their competitors showing international and UK delivery info but also highlighting current promotions in an area every site visitor will see. M&S almost always has sales on some areas of the site and this allows the retailer to flag these to everyone who lands on the site. Another retailer showing their delivery and returns info but Boux Avenue is worth a mention as whereas other retailers have lumped the promo strip on top of their existing design Boux have folded it very neatly in with the overall look/theme of the site. Naked's version differs slightly from others. Firstly it's above the navigation. Secondly it introduces some urgency and a deadline with their in the next XX minutes for next day delivery call to action. Penhaligon's fill this area of dead space in its layout with delivery info but also very usefully for a heavily gifted brand promotes its free gift wrapping service here. As with Naked Wines Pen Heaven again focuses on urgency offering same day engraving for orders before a particular time. It also features customer reviews heavily here great for a smaller brand that visitors may not have heard of. Kiddicare is probably the UK's leading baby product website. it also leads the way here with its promo strip. First it beats out all of the standard promos with next day delivery in hour slots. Second it shows off the 365 day return policy. Third Kiddicare offers a price match promise. Taking it far further the retailer has added these strips down either side of the main content. These strips are hidden if you're on a smaller resolution 1024x768. For anyone on a larger monitor they reinforce the price match fast despatch but also show off their many awards and promote their 119\,000 product reviews. As you can see these have popped up all over the place. They're a very simple addition to highlight features or info you want to show off to all of your visitors. If you run an e-commerce site and haven't already tried this it's worth testing. If you're already running this with the bog standard delivery over it's worth trialing some other ideas to see the impact they have. There are some nice extensions to this too personalising them to include discount codes depending on traffic source etc. If you're willing to A/B test it it's probably worth paying more attention to the impact it has on visitors or first time buyers rather than your overall conversion rate. Do leave a comment if you've seen any other interesting examples of this or had any experience yourself around results. Dan Barker is an E-Business Consultant and a guest blogger on Econsultancy.

Alternatively see our The Future of Digital Marketing 2010 Presentations or E-commerce Platforms Buyer's Guide. Head of Usability Conversion at PRWD. 12:36PM on 9th February 2012. Great article Dan highlighting something which I have been talking about and presenting ideas on over the last 12 months. The promo strip is a great example of a design pattern which I am seeing users actively engage with during user testing sessions. Your summary of the benefits of this feature is spot on too.. a very useful addition from both the customer perspective informative without being overbearing and from the brand perspective orientated without being overbearing!). Picking up on the Naked Wines example you have provided they have in fact featured this countdown timer since they launched their site and its a superb way to deliver a persuasive technique a sense of urgency to which you can almost guarantee all site visitors will see even if only sub-consciously. A quick recommendation I make to retailers when they are implementing these strips is to not try cramming too many messages in the space. If you compare John Lewis to Pen Heaven or Kiddicare it takes less effort to scan the latter two sites messages along with them using visual elements to help differentiate the messages. Thanks again for a great post. E-Business Consultant at Dan Barker. 12:54PM on 9th February 2012. Thanks Paul And great advice. Interestingly I don't think the Naked Wines design had it from the start. I could be wrong but I think this was their original http://bit.ly/originalnw. I think that makes a nice point too it's really useful to test this kind of thing to find out what works for your site your audience and your business needs. Thanks again. dan. Senior Marketing Manager Personalisation MVT at Tesco.com. 1:19PM on 9th February 2012. Agree on your point that its been quietly bubbling away on many e-com sites without too much focus. Very useful used in the right way. One thing I've not seen is contextualising and personalising this area there are pros and cons associated with this but used correctly you could use profile data on the user first visit categories browsed etc to provide some persuasive prompting e.g. for a first time visitor provide generic deliver/returns/click collect/etc info and start tailoring the message as a visitor moves from first time to a potential customer to becoming a customer etc.. and then within things that fit your brand such as male/female the M&S example simply choosing whether to display the Men's or Women's Trouser Offer. 1:31PM on 9th February 2012. Great article Dan They are fantastic examples of persuading the user without bombarding them with too much information. I couldn't agree more with Paul about the scanning the messages. How adding a bit of colour to break the different messages down alongside more leading text. Another great example of this is ASOS they really are fantastic and persuading through out the customer journey. Ecommerce Director at Eurosimm Ltd. 2:15PM on 9th February 2012. Interesting to see so many retailers using the bar to promote their delivery offerings. Perhaps it's because most of their customers are familiar with their wider propositions so they don't need to push the choose us message. I'd advocate using the bar to push the key USPs for the business particularly for smaller less well known retailers fighting to make their mark. It would be interesting to see eye tracking studies or survey people using sites featuring promo bars to see if the content registers with them or not. Given that the bar is likely to be in their eyeline as they journey through the site I'd wager that it registers subconsciously even if they dont actively read it. Analyst at CxFocus. 3:43PM on 9th February 2012. Very interesting indeed. Thanks Dan. I think it's very good when patterns like these start to emerge. As with top navigation and side navigation email address then password for login as an even more common one it helps if new visitors have some expectation of where some things may be. I agree with Albie that the choose us message is very important too. Not one of these examples does much along those lines. I think they're assuming everyone will recognise them which is no longer a safe bet. But in fact I think a USP message need to be bigger and more prominent than these strips. One question for Paul you mention people engaging with these strips in usability tests. Was that just mentioning them in out loud or actually clicking please I'm reassured either way because all too often I find people manage to miss even prominent messages. But I'm also slightly concerned if someone's first reaction when landing on a site was to click for details on something like this even if it does demonstrate a keen commercial intent. 3:49PM on 9th February 2012. In most instances it was displayed on the main page and as the writer pointed out it can appear on all pages. I believe it could be very useful as it is an upsell on the checkout page. It distracts from the natural flow of the menu and home page flow and would cause most consumers to pause just long enough to wonder why they are there and leave. A more interesting study Albie would be a correlation between eye tracking and conversion rates as while I certainly agree it's a great idea it's the type of distraction that can potentially loose a customer if over used. It would be unusual that something like this would have been incorporated into the original design of the site and as such adding it afterwords without breaking up the natural flow of the original design would be difficult. I think it's an excellent way to drawer additional value to your site but only if used in moderation and where a customer might naturally expect to see it. Very nice article Dan. Cheers Robert. 9:13AM on 10th February 2012. I've done some research around this area and have started to call them confidence banners since they often don't aim to directly convert with a call to action merely instill confidence in the customer making them more likely to make a purchase later on. Analyst at CxFocus. 11:14AM on 10th February 2012. That's interesting Rich. What kind of research did you do Or is that a cheeky question I'm not asking for intrusive detail just the general type of thing. 4:54PM on 10th February 2012. Not at all Tim Mainly the importance and distinction between two types of banners we've come to identify as confidence banners and conversion banners. Also general practice in placement and functionality of each. Conversion banners usually being more prominent on a page and containing a direct call to action.

These stats were released today as the company also launched a Windows 7 version of its mobile app the seventh channel that's now available for mobile sales. Mobile has proved to be a hugely successful avenue for Domino’s the company’s iPhone app alone has generated over in sales in the past year and now accounts for 4.1 of all online orders. Domino's head of commercial systems Paul Francis says that the brand lends itself brilliantly to mobile retail. 13 of all digital sales come though a tablet or smartphone so we know that for many customers mobile is the preferred way of ordering. We have ambitious plans for 2012 and I am delighted that we can offer this new app for the Windows Phone 7 platform. We look forward to hearing what our customers think.. Whereas Domino’s multimedia manager Nick Dutch highlighted that this new app release built by Vexed Digital is a response to developing consumer trends and staying of the game. With WP7 we see a great opportunity to get into the hands of loyal Nokia fans who will be upgrading as WP7 launches.. Back in September we reviewed Domino’s iPad app which to this day provides a significant advantage for the company over its main rival Pizza Hut which has not done anything with mobile at all the UK at least. Like the iPhone version the iPad app by Somo is well designed and intuitive to use and the larger screen allows it to use high resolution images of its pizzas. The brand also released a second app in the app in the US in November. Named Pizza Hero it’s a game format that times how long it takes for you to virtually top a pizza with points awarded for performance. Once you've passed levels one through five affectionately nicknamed Pizza School other players will get a chance to rate your performance. Players can then of course order a real delivery through the app. Domino's also announced today that it was reviewing its digital and direct marketing account. A large proportion of Domino's marketing budget is spent on digital advertising with nearly half of its pizza sales now made online. Vikki is News Editor for Econsultancy.

Posted 10 February 2012 09:22am by Matt Owen with 1 comment Having made it to the shortlist for the 2012 Econsultancy Innovation Awards it’s fair to say the people we’ve been interviewing this week know a thing or two about bright ideas. Today we asked them to cast an eye back over the last twelve months and identify the innovations they feel have had the biggest effect on the marketing landscape. Of course hindsight is always 20/20 so we also challenged them to gaze ahead and offer their opinions on the trends to watch in 2012.. Unsurprisingly there was a lot of crossover with mobile video and social technologies all emerging as consistent trends to watch. While some technologies are still in their infancy savvy marketers are starting to experiment with new channels as soon as the opportunity presents itself. The of Mobile may have been repeated to the point of cliché but many contributors felt that 2011 was the year when mobile devices became ubiquitous. Concerns about multichannel attribution finally became a reality for marketers while optimisation and platform relevance would increase in importance going forward. Nishma Robb Business Development Marketing Director at I Spy Marketing summed this up nicely In 2011 we were told that it was the year of mobile although we at I Spy thought that it was the year of the smartphone. This year we think that it will be the year of multichannel integration on smartphones. While many others commented on the expected expansion of the market in 2012. Maani Safa Innovation Director at Somo talked about the role of tablets. Looking ahead I believe there will be an explosion in tablet-first applications. To date the mobile space has predominantly focused on consumer markets. In the year ahead I am particularly interested in how mobile and tablet devices can be put to use within the enterprise. Jonathan Horden MD/COO at PrismaStar. The rise of the tablet whether it's Apple’s iPad or Amazon’s Kindle innovation in tablet technology has been phenomenal in 2011 and has now bridged the gap from early adopter to main stream technology must have. Could these be the death of the laptop. Jonathan also felt that understanding the data setsprovided by multiple devices would be key to success in the future a view echoed by a number of those we interviewed The biggest trend has to be convergence creating a unified online experience across whatever channel the consumer wants to interact with the ability to transfer that experience to any other media. This includes mobile phones tablets the PC at work the laptop at home calls to telesales or customer services and any in-store experience. A shopper can browse for products on our in-store kiosks transfer results to his home PC or mobile device complete the transaction with a telesales operative or any combination of the above The entire experience is consistent and integrated across all channels. Chris Ward\,European MD at Kenshoo and HSBC Expat’s Head of Marketing Lisa Wood also felt strongly about this Chris Ward. I think the biggest trend for 2012 will be consolidation. With multiple new channels emerging marketers will want to consolidate all their activity on one platform/dashboard. It has become even more important now to be able to see the larger picture and understand how all the different marketing activities tie in together to help achieve a goal. Lisa Wood. Increasingly businesses also need to view and manage all their digital activity in the wider context of the marketing ecosystem. Everything is interconnected. Paid media can launch a viral campaign based on owned content generating earned media conversations and links which drive traffic improve search engine rankings and ultimately save money in paid media ads that can be reinvested. Overlaying this will be the need for one analytics package that allows businesses to see the effects of digital marketing efforts across the ecosystem and ultimately compare ROI of paid owned and earned media using a common set of metrics. Lisa was one of many who believed in the growing importance of video next year despite the problems presented by multiple platform deployment. In addition many believe that TV will once more move to the forefront for advertisers thanks to connected technologies and increased integration. Lisa explains. Google TV was probably inevitable but the fact that you can now use your mobile as a remote control for your TV when you’re on the move is a great innovation. Increasingly I think we’ll see mobile devices being able to control all aspects of your life. 3D TV is starting to really take-off and the fact that you’re going to be able to view 3D TV without glasses will mean this innovation is more than a fad. Couple this with the latest camera gadgets that allow you to shoot your own 3D film and this becomes a really interesting area. As founder of video agency Adjust Your Set Chris Gorell Barnes is well placed to comment on increasing importance of video. Video will be everywhere. So prevalent has video become as the pre-eminent communication tool of our age that Cisco has claimed that by 2015 1m minutes of video will cross the internet every second. The next 12 months we’ll see a rise in communication and engagement using video across multiple channels. There will also be a rise in mobile as a marketing channel particularly mobile vouchers and these devices working together engaging with content that will lead to sales for brands both via e-commerce and in-store. Michael Steckler Managing Director Northern Europe for Criteo told us Connected TV/Video online driven by both social applications and devices the way we consume TV will never be the same again morphing into sophisticated applications which allow you to interact in real-time. Miso and Zeebox are a couple of examples of companies that are really taking the lead in the social video space. Video is an area where we will probably see more consolidation. With $160bn to play for globally it’s an extremely hot area and much like display advertising we may start to see a divergence between video advertising that has a more direct response data multiple creative and real-time user feedback and brand advertising which will be driven more by the content experience engaging formats and new distribution channels. Overall respondents felt that 2012 would see an increased leap into multichannel with more accurate data attribution and tracking combining with increased use of mobile technology to create a more socially driven experience. Dan Robins is Head of Paid Search at Carat iProspect. I think 2012 will be the first year digital properly bridges the gap into offline. Carat has proven the link between search and in store sales Google is releasing more voucher-type products QR codes have really exploded despite many years in the doldrums to name a few and I think advertisers are no longer able to view their online channel in isolation. Added to this I think digital marketers will finally make the break through into exactly how to get to grips with attribution modelling. For all too long we’ve been talking about it as being important to look into but the models have been slow to produce unwieldy and really speaking didn’t show to much of use. As cross-channel technologies such as Ignition One and Marin develop and their use grows more advertisers will find it easier to build cross-channel attribution models and actually put them to good use driving efficiency in their activity. This increased ability to track consumer behaviour looks set to transform campaigns making it possible for companies to provide truly integrated optimised journeys for the first time. This in turn is driving a remodelling of display and targeted marketing messages. Deepak Jha VP of Commercial at tour booking site isango Covered all of this in his response. Mobile. As more attractions and tour organisers start accepting paperless vouchers tablets become more sophisticated and roaming charges come down the battle will shift from search to bookings. Social media. Integration of facebook and the trading websites so that brands can influence customers based on the behaviours and attitudes of their friends in the reference group. Globalisation The ability to adapt the business to local context in emerging markets like BRICS India Russia China South Africa and MENA East and North Africa. We rolled out Love Orlando Tickets to Brazil recently and got an excellent response however there were many local contextual factors that we had to address on the way.. Do you think that increased globalisation and multiple touchpoint campaigns will increase or do you feel that personalised journeys are still out of reach on traditional platforms like TV despite new interactive and integrated technology We’d love to hear your opinions in the comments.

Posted 10 February 2012 10:38am by Graham Charlton with 0 comments The Mirror relaunched its website this week with a cleaner design and integration of personalisation technology. I've been talking to Product Director at Trinity Mirror Econsultancy guest blogger Malcolm Coles about the thinking behind the new site design. Why have you relaunched the site. The old website has been around for several years with an old content management system. We wanted to give our journalists a more modern tool to publish their work and we also needed a new platform which would enable us to integrate social media more effectively. Now we have a new CMS and we’re trying new technology such as the personalised news suggestions from London-based startup Rummble Labs. What are the main goals of the new site We aim to increase the number of pages viewed per visit by each user and features such as the personalised recommendations will help us to achieve this. Another aim is to showcase our great photography more than we did with the old site. That one had plenty of photos but didn’t really provide the space the show them properly. Now journalists can add metadata to posts with great photos and they will be given more prominence. We also wanted to have fewer ad slots but make them more appealing and therefore more valuable to users. We're definitely not going down the paywall route. Also comments will be open on all articles by default which is the opposite of how it used to be so we hope this will encourage more people to stick around and leave their views. They’ll be on now for most stories though for legal reasons not every single one. How do you handle comments We use the latest version of Pluck which has some built-in moderation tools and we post-moderate all comments in part relying on readers to flag inappropriate comments. How does the personalisation work The old site was relatively cluttered and though we promoted a lot of stories on thr homepage I think it gave people has less idea of where to look and go on the site. Before launching this version we spent a lot of time working out how to help people find what they want. People tend to snack on news sites maybe browsing during breaks lunch hours and so on and personalisation helps them to find something that will interest them. The technology will learn from the articles that people choose to read as they browse the site and will recommend a further reading list at the right hand side of articles. These are based on the user’s viewing history and will recommend stories based on this and what other people who liked the same article also liked. In addition users can sign in with their Facebook logins and receive recommendations based on their interests. Recommended news pulls up a list so a 30 year old woman with an interest in celebrity sees something different than a 40 year old Arsenal supporting man. One thing I noticed on the new site was the drop down menus. These are now common in e-commerce but less so on news sites. Yes e-commerce sites have increasingly used these as a way of allowing people to see each section at a glance quickly access product pages deep in the site. In the same way these provide our users with a shortcut to the main stories in each menu as well as allowing them to see the top stories in each section at a glance. Now you've launched the new site will you continue to test and tweak. With the previous redesign 2008) it was launched and then nothing much was changed after that. There were a lot of user testing before relaunching this version of the site and we’ll be using lots of MVT as we go on as well as learning what works and what doesn’t from web analytics data. Which sections people use most how they navigate around the site and so on. We’ll then be able to make changes to improve and increase usage of the site. Have you relaunched the mobile site too What proportion of traffic comes through this channel Yes we've also launched m.mirror.co.uk mobile site all built in HTML5. Mobile traffic currently accounts for an eighth of all traffic though it wouldn’t surprise me if it overtakes online at some point. Later in the year we’ll also be looking at iPads and tablets. the question is whether we design apps or optimise for tablets using style sheets. Graham Charlton is Editor at Econsultancy.

Posted 10 February 2012 13:17pm by Graham Charlton with 1 comment Launched in 2011 Tripomatic is a new website which helps users plan holidays as well as activities and places to see wherever they go. I've been asking the team about Tripomatic.. Tripomatic is a free trip planner that makes planning holiday easy fast and fun. Planning a trip usually takes a lot of time and it can be quite frustrating. You have to go through many websites to get all necessary information print a bunch of papers and you are still not sure you will find your way in the city. We wanted to change that. We developed a website that recommends must-see places in a selected destination. People can choose what they want to see and add activities for each day of their trip. In addition they can also keep track of flights and accommodation and see how far the places are. Everything is displayed on the map for easier orientation. After planning the trip users can download their personalised travel guide and use it on the trip. Tripomatic launched in June 2011 after 7 months of development. We decided to make a tool for holiday planning after spending hours on preparing our own trip to Switzerland. Some people may think planning is a great part of travelling but we are definitely not one of them. Our target audience are independent travellers who want to make the most of their holiday. We are intensively working on our mobile app that should be launched soon. Another goal is to increase our coverage. Right now we cover most of Europe and the USA but we want to extend the coverage by two more continents till the end of the year. Making Tripomatic very easy to use. We have tons of ideas what would be great to have at the website but we learned to be careful with new features. In the past we added functionality that seemed very useful but user testing showed that our visitors found it confusing or too difficult to use and it had negative impact on the overall user experience. Tripomatic offers booking accommodation car hire city tours and other services. We get a commission on each sale made through our website. Unlike most startups Tripomatic.com is a family business and is owned by a married couple. They both have great experience in online marketing and website development. Besides the owners there are three developers three people in marketing and four content editors. We focus mostly on product development adding new content and promoting the website. Most of us were working together on another travel website before. As all team members love travelling lots of ideas for new features come from using Tripomatic on our own trips. In one year we would like to have an awesome product that will be used and loved by travellers. We want to cover all major tourist destinations all round the world. We also hope that our mobile app will be successful and it will become one of the best apps for travel planning. In three years we want to be a well-known brand and be profitable. And where would we like to be in five year’s time Seychelles No seriously it is just way too far in the future for us we never plan for such a long time ahead.

Most Popular on MWN. Latest Opinion. Polls. Login. Sponsored Ads. Disclaimer. Connect with MWN. About MWN. By Larbi Arbaoui. Morocco World News. Taroudant Morocco February 5 2012. Like many Muslim countries the Moroccan people celebrate the birth of the Prophet Mohammad be upon him on February 5. This celebration is known by different names in the Islamic world. In Morocco it’s called Al Mouloud\,â or simply Mouloud.â It is an occasion when Moroccans show their devotion to their faith a spiritual day to recall the ideals of Islam and recite poems dedicated to the Prophet though some of the cultural conventions surrounding this holiday have little to do with Islam. On February 5 when walking past a mosque spiritually uplifting recitations of the holy Quran can be heard. People exchange visits and organize religious parties at which Mouloudiate\,â a series of long poems eulogising and praising the Prophet Mohammad are recited. The most famous poem is Burdahâ by Sheikh Al Bussiri. In early morning men will walk together to the graveyard singing Burdahâ and women will warble when the men pass by. In the evening the sound of the Attalba reading the Quran and reciting hymns glorifying God can be heard coming from houses along with the fragrant odor of incense and sandal wood. The Attalba are religious people who memorize the Quran and master the Islamic legislature. They read and recite until dinner traditionally couscous is served. The city of SalÃ© on the Bou Regreg estuary holds a lantern procession on Al Mouloud called Dor Eshamaa. In Meknes in the square of Saint Sheikh Al Kamel the celebration on this day takes a barbaric turn. Men and women engage in wild dances using knives to strike their foreheads and eat hot embers and drink boiling water. The dancers who wear white see themselves in an ecstatic state of joy. Visitors must wear white in order to participate or risk receiving violent treatment. Wearing black or red is considered an offense and those who do may have their clothes torn. Perhaps the strangest aspect of this ceremony is the custom of the infirm laying at the gate of the shrine in order for the the followers of the Saint to heal them by walking on their backs. In Tazarine Al Mouloud is considered an important and dignified day. In the early morning readings of the holy Quran can be heard from a distance. Men dress in white and exchange smiles and expressions of courtesy. The day of when couscous is served is the busiest day with loud music from tambourines. It is believed that thanks to Saint Sidi Amrou a dish of couscous twice as wide as the width of the door can be passed through the door. Tradition says that anyone who looks while the miracle takes place will be struck blind. On Al Mouloud the sacred coexists with the profane. In Meknes for example at the same time as some are engaged in the pagan ritual of ecstatic dancing others are inside mosques reading the Quran or studying the Prophet’s biography. The decadent and barbarous practices should be done away with and efforts should be made to preserve only those traditions dedicated to celebrating the Prophet. Edited by Jasmine Davey.

Kenitra Morocco February 5 2012. Women have celebrated in the last decades their emancipation from the constraints of a traditionally manâ€TMs world. The sexÂ has proven itself in many domains. Women have become engaged in politics and so are able to take part in defending their rights and creating change though what change is required is understood differently among different groups. Women have been in the media thanks to the hard work of many years to empower their gender in the Arab world. Some Moroccan women have used their bodies as part of a feminist agenda. After years of fighting political and social constraints a new form of protest has arisen. In Morocco some women have shown up semi-nude and others threatened to appear nude in the streets or on TV to challenge the Islamists that dominate the newly nominated govenment of BenKirane the leader of PJD. For example the Moroccan celebrity actress Latifa Ahrar showedÂ her shaved legs and breasts to national and international cameras at the Marrakesh Film Festival. And she has commented that she won’t stop performing in a semi-nude theater role which serves as a challenge to the Islamic party PJD. Ahrar has already played a theater role in a play called Naoum\,Â requiring semi-nudity. Another example of women using their body as a means of power can be seen in some new Moroccan movies. For instance the erotic role played by Fatima El Ayachi in Maouchouma.Â. El Ayachi said that she was challenging convention and that she is ready to play other bold roles. She also commented that body and indecency are not the same\,Â and that she is proud of this movie and herself as a Muslim Moroccan Amazigh woman. In this way\,a womanâ€TMs body has functioned as a tool of protest against any patriarch who claims that the her body is shameful and indecent and should be hidden from public view. Some women like those mentioned previously have used their bodies as a means of honor and power to call for freedom from oppression and from injustice against their sex. They have utilised their beauty to provoke the Islamists who have been called misogynists. Protest in the shape of a womanâ€TMs body has raised many questions about the teachings of Islam and the social conventions of Moroccan society. Edited by Jasmine Davey.

CAIRO Egypt February 5 2012 Saboteurs on Sunday blew up a pipeline that supplies gas to Israel the 12th such attack in a year security officials said. Masked gunmen planted explosives under the pipeline in the Al-Massaeed area close to the town of El-Arish in the north of the Sinai peninsula they said. Witnesses said they heard a very loud explosion before a large fire broke out. Sources say the attack on the pipeline came the day after an Islamist leader from the area died in his prison cell in Cairo. Interior ministry officials said he died from natural causes. Emergency services were rushed to the scene to try to control the blaze the official said adding that there were no immediate reports of casualties. The pipeline which carries gas through the Sinai and on to Jordan and Israel has already been attacked 11 times over the past year the first during the mass uprisings that drove president Hosni Mubarak from power in February 2011. Gas deliveries to Israel agreed under Mubarak have come under heavy criticism in Egypt. Israel generates 40 percent of its electricity using natural gas and Egypt provides 43 percent of its gas supplies. Egyptian gas also covers 80 percent of Jordan’s electricity production demand 6.8 million cubic metres a day. Egypt’s Sinai region is particularly security sensitive due to tensions with the Bedouin community living there which is heavily armed. Many goods are smuggled to the Palestinian enclave of Gaza through the Sinai which the Israelis also charge is a rear base for militant attacks against its territory.

Abdelmoula Elkhdar. Morocco World News. Khouribga Morocco February 5 2012. Culture is pristine yet itâ€TMs subject to being unauthenticized and de-contextualized. Culture as perceived by locals is always authentic. I am talking here about both tangible and intangible aspects of culture. When tourists come in the guise of neocolonialism cultures are altered commodified and hegemonized opening the door wide open to many interpretations and amendments. The local pure culture becomes in my view like an old whore opening its legs to whoever pays more wearing cheap cosmetics to meet the clientsâ€TM needs. When the cultural value is being transformed by a commercial one the meaning of culture is lost and the pure past is re-told aloof from the original version When we sell culture as a commodity we rob our locals of any sense of belonging. Culture hence becomes a hybrid almost like parrot that tried to imitate the pigeonâ€TMs walk and ended up walking in a weird ugly wayâ€TM as the Moroccan legend goes. The parrot in this respect is the culture that is commodified to fit the touristsâ€TM desires without taking into account the localsâ€TM needs and without respecting their glorious past. Marie-FranÃ§oise Lanfant states that tourism increases culture declines.â There are a lot of examples of Moroccan culture we no longer see today or we see them in new forms. Take the example of the story tellers in the mythical square of Jemaa El fna Marrakesh. In the past that was a real entertainment for the locals with both socio-economic and educational perspectives a pure culture. The story teller was a well-read man a scholar a historian...etc. Today story telling is becoming a mere spectacle devoid of any humanistic meaning and is seen to be authentic only by tourists because they see through different lens that distort the genuine authenticity of this art lens that satiate their unconscious fantasies and dreams. Even the food in our culture is altered commodified and The Moroccan couscous is no longer keeping its secret within the confines of this nation. Itâ€TMs re-packaged and marketed worldwide. As something deeply rooted in the Moroccan culture couscous is not becoming authentic any more. Chances are that when you eat couscous in Morocco in a Moroccan restaurant you are not eating authentic Couscous that our mothers and grandmothers used to roll in their Baraka-palms and serve for couple of hands to share on a table of brotherhood .Worse when you eat it outside the country chances are you will end up eating something named couscous but has nothing to do with our cultural dish. Itâ€TMs devalued de-contextualized defamed and drained of its entire cultural load. Consequently tourism is demonizing the local culture and simplifying it to a trademark a cheap commodity in a luring package a titillating attraction. In brief Marxâ€TMs natural use-value of culture is put on the line. Marco Polo traveled for some 24 years but never meant to distort the Chinese culture he met. Today however and to Marcoâ€TMs dismay the Wall of China is becoming a commodity with modernized cafes malls and parking lots. The Chinese nowadays donâ€TMt consider the Great Wall great itâ€TMs becoming part of a modern life. Likewise Mardi Gras or Fat Tuesday in New Orleans Louisiana is no longer conceived as a local indigenous heritage and a celebration rich of symbolism. Rather itâ€TMs becoming a commodity which is promoted by marketers to gain more money without caring for the damage they made to the local culture. Who cares now about those women who exchange their breasts for beads Or are they mere trivialities and commodities. We should as a matter of fact go beyond this image and look at the other side of the coin. We should give culture the value it deserves. Suffice it if we sell tangible aspects of our cultures There is no urgent need to barter our dear human culture for a few euros and dollars exchange our kids and womenâ€TMs flesh in the sacred name of the promotion of tourism with old octogenarian human predators. In a nutshell tourism is bad Our are endangered.â. El khdar Abdelmoula is a social organizer.

In the wake of another bloody massacre in which over 200 people were killed and over 1\,000 injured in the central city of Homs on Friday night by the Syrian regime Tunisia decided on Saturday to expel the Syrian ambassador to Tunis and to withdraw its recognition of the regime of Bashar al-Assad as the legitimate representative of the Syrian people announced the Tunisian presidency. According to a statement on his Facebook page the Tunisian president called on the president Assad to down in order to help spare Syrian blood. Moncef Marzouki went on to say that only solution the crisis in Syria is the removal from power of Bashar al Assad and the launch of a democratic transition.â. In an interview with Aljazeera on Saturday Tunisiaâ€TMs Secretary of State Abdessalem Rafik said that as it has been proactive in starting the revolution it makes sense to be proactive in solidarity with our brothers in Syria. is the most-expected attitude expressed by this government that derives its legitimacy from the revolution\,â€ he added. He also hoped that most Arab country especially Egypt Morocco and the Gulf countries would follow Tunisia in its step toward severing all ties with the Syrian regime. Tunisiaâ€TMs daring move came after Russia and Chinaâ€TMs veto today to a U.N. Security Council resolution aimed at ending Syriaâ€TMs bloodshed among concerns that Damascus might heighten its clampdown on the protestors who entered their nearly 11-month uprising.

And that’s the way they like it. Why else would they call this area along the northeastern part of Florida’s panhandle the coast It is remote undeveloped and at this time of year no one’s here. Oh wait. I should have said no tourists. Out in the flat-as-glass Apalachicola Bay every morning we found dozens of oyster boats quietly harvesting the famous shellfish from the shallow sea floor. They say it gets busy during the summer but it’s a different kind of busy than frenetic Panama City to the west or St. Petersburg the closest major city along the coast as you head southeast. Forgotten-coast busy means something else. It’s a little harder to find a parking spot at St. George Island State Park but the beach remains subdued by Sunshine State standards. You might have a hard time getting a seat at Harry A’s or BJ’s around dinnertime on the weekends but otherwise they say it’s more or less the same place all year round. Our vacation rental looked out over the bay. The units on the other two sides were dark their windows shuttered for the season. We watched the sun rise over the ocean in the morning as we sipped tea. find a strong cup of espresso but you have to drive across two long bridges into Apalachicola to find it. It’s at the Cafe Con Leche.. The biggest attraction on St. George other than the state park and the ever-present oystermen is the lighthouse. Back in 2005 the Cape St. George Lighthouse fell into the Gulf of Mexico. Preservationists rallied to save the 1852 landmark and in late 2008 the reconstructed tower reopened. A new museum just next door is only a few weeks old. We also swung by the Apalachicola National Estuarine Research Reserve to check out its recently opened exhibit daughter offers a tour of the fish tanks in the video below. It’s one of only 28 national estuarine research reserves nationwide and you’ll leave with a much clearer picture of why areas like these are worth protecting. In talking with the few year-round residents of St. George Island we met it became clear that getting is a good thing in a place like Florida. Most of the coastal areas are overdeveloped with high-rise hotels and condos competing for the best view of the gulf or the ocean. It’s fun for a few days of R&R maybe or maybe not. In order to really appreciate the remoteness of the forgotten coast you have to head inland to the Apalachicola National Forest. On our last day we did just that. Covering more than half a million acres it’s the largest national forest in the state and true to its billing it showed us what this place must have looked like before the area was settled. At a remote campground at this time of year was abandoned) we ran into the only person we’d seen all day a woman who worked at nearby Tyndall Air Force Base. She was looking for the lighthouse on St. George Island and had gotten lost along the way. We stood at the edge of the bay admiring the chocolate-milk colored water framed by seagrass and I said to her lost isn’t so bad is it?. No she said. Not here. Elliott writes The Insider column for National Geographic Traveler. Heâ€TMs traveling across the country with his family and blogging about the experience on hisÂ family travel blog Away Is Home. My husband and i just love St\,George Island We went there just 2 yrs\,ago to see the the lighthouse and just love it!We usually try to run down every time we are in Florida to see everything!We like to wander all over the island \,just enjoying everything!It is so beautiful there!!!!!!.

Jennifer Garcia-Alonso is co-founder of The Purple Passport a web-based collection of chic one-stop-shop guides to experiencing the worldâ€TMs cities in style. She is a New Yorker who has been living in Abu Dhabi the capital of the United Arab Emirates for the past three years we think qualifies her as a local at this point. Check out Jennifer’s take on her home away from home then leave a comment below if you have anything to add. The first place I take a visitor from out of town is Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque an architectural wonder. It is the largest Mosque outside of Mecca or Medina. When I crave Indian food I always go to Ushna in The Souk at Qaryat al Beri. Donâ€TMt miss the black lentils and the terrace seating with views of the Grand Mosque. Overall Indian food in Abu Dhabi is exceptional. To escape the city I head out to the Qasr al Sarab Desert Resort by Anantara. It is located about 90 minutes outside the city among the deep desert dunes. Qasr al Sarab Desert Resort Jennifer Garcia-Alonso. If I want to shop I go to the impressive Marina Mall. For complete quiet I can hide away at Yas Links golf course. Even non-golfers can enjoy the luxurious pool and outdoor dining with views of the golf course and water. If you come to my city get your picture taken with a camel You can find them right in town at the Abu Dhabi Heritage Village or if you book a 4×4 desert safari you are sure to encounter a few of the desert safaris also offer camel rides. If you have to order one thing off the menu from Hakkasan it has to be the Jasmine-tea-soaked Wagyu beef ribs. Magrudyâ€TMs is my one-stop shop for great books. As an expat I love a taste of home and they will order any book in print for you. Locals know to skip those boring hotel bars and check out the dramatic Skylite at the Yas Viceroy Hotel located inside the Formula 1 circuit instead. When Iâ€TMm feeling cash-strapped I go to the beach. For a huge splurge I go to dessert and coffee at the Emirates Palace hotel. Pricey pastries are dusted in gold and if you are really adventurous you can get a cappuccino made with camel milk. The opulent hotel is worth a visit in itself it cost around $3 billion USD to construct and is an important Abu Dhabi landmark. If you are really splurging pick up some gold in the lobby vending machine. Photo ops in my city include the Corniche and the Sheikh Zayed Grand Mosque. The best vantage points are Heritage Village and The Souk at Qaryat al Beri respectively both spots you get views from across the water. If my city were a celebrity itâ€TMd be Colin Firth international strong and relatively reserved. The most random thing about my city is the nail salons and spas. They are everywhere and if you are willing to venture outside your hotel relatively economical. Women here are especially well groomed. My city has the most international men and women. While Emirati locals of course play a crucial role in defining the culture and trajectory of the city most people who live in Abu Dhabi are not from here. In my city an active day outdoors involves water sports. Check out the Al Forsan complex for wake boarding and water skiing offerings. My cityâ€TMs best museum is yet to come. Abu Dhabi locations of The Louvre and The Guggenheim as well as an impressive National Museum are planned for the future. My favorite jogging/walking route is the Corniche downtown with views of the Arabian Gulf. For a night of dancing go to Allure on Yas Island. Or for live music check out the Yas Island Concert Series. Everyone from Guns Nâ€TM Roses to Shakira to Janet Jackson to Metallica has performed here. Maroush is the spot for late-night eats. Shawarma time. To find out whatâ€TMs going on at night and on the weekends read Time Out. You can tell a lot about my city from a walk downtown. Notice all of the languages and nationalities represented. You can tell if someone is from my city if they smell wonderful. Perfumes and colognes are a big part of local culture. Hiking Liwa Dunes Jennifer Garcia-Alonso. In the winter you should play outside This is when the weather is at its best water sports golf tennis and desert excursions are all perfect winter choices. In the spring you should see Abu Dhabi from the water. Hire a dhow wooden boat for a tour charter a speedboat to take you to one of the 200 islands off the main island or kayak in the mangroves. In the summer you should stay inside Temperatures consistently remain above 105F and the humidity level is quite high. In the fall you should hit the Formula 1 festivities the yachts in the Yas Marina the unbelievable concerts and of course the races are all worth seeing. A hidden gem in my city is India Palace. Another great economical choice for Indian eats. For a fantastic breakfast try CuiScene at the Fairmont. For about $25 USD you get a full I mean full breakfast buffet. And the restaurant features a lovely terrace to boot. Luxury for less. Donâ€TMt miss the Abu Dhabi Art Fair in November. It brings together contemporary art and design from all over the world. Just outside my city you can visit Dubai. Itâ€TMs about a 60 to 80 minute drive. If you come to the UAE you get two vacations in one. With public transportation options at a minimum the best way to see my city is by car or taxi. The city is increasingly spread out with attractions like Ferrari World amusement park Yas Marina Circuit of the Formula 1) Monte Carlo Beach Club and Saadiyat Beach Golf Club all located a good distance from City Center. If my city were a pet it would be a bird small in size but ready to fly. If I didnâ€TMt live in a city Iâ€TMd live on the beach somewhere. Warm weather is a big thing for me. The best book about my city is From Rags to Riches A Story of Abu Dhabi. When I think about my city the song that comes to mind is Movinâ€TM On Up While growth plans for Abu Dhabi are substantially more conservative than its sibling Dubai new hotels malls office buildings attractions and high rise apartment buildings apartment in the skyâ bit fits too!. are quickly appearing and the city has gained critical importance on the world stage. If you have kids you wonâ€TMt want to miss the hotel beach and pool clubs. For example the Hiltonia Beach Club offers day passes and has child and adult pools a beach water sports and restaurants. National Day celebrations could only happen in my city. Emirati locals and non-locals alike celebrate the young countryâ€TMs birthday UAE just turned 40 with flags fireworks special parades and lots of driving and honking horns. My city should be featured on your cover or website because it is cosmopolitan international full of wonderful surprises and growing quickly.

By Annie Fitzsimmons. to the Wild West of China\, my guide said as we touched down in Lijiang after a 4-hour from Shanghai. Though I didnâ€TMt yet spot any cowboy boots I was indeed far west in the Yunnan province at the foothills of the Himalaya bordered by Laos Vietnam and Burma. Impressions of Lijiang performance Annie Fitzsimmons. For an instant introduction to the region I attended a performance of of Lijiang\, with the sacred Jade Dragon Mountain looming behind the outdoor theater. It is truly a spectacle of local culture with hundreds of the minority Naxi people performing songs and dances. And no wonder the show is such a creative triumph the force behind it is Zhang Yimou famous for directing the Opening and Closing Ceremonies at the Beijing Olympics. I couldn’t leave without purchasing a recording of the music that could transport me back to Lijiang over and over again. The area is difficult to navigate on your own. I traveled on an Abercrombie Kent itinerary with the warmest expert guide Gerald Hatherly. He makes centuries of Chinese history come alive daily. A&K is known for making far-ï¬‚ung getaways like the Yunnan accessible and also happens to be celebrating its 50th anniversary this year. The Banyan Tree was our base in Lijiang and its architecture reï¬‚ected the design of the Naxi homes while providing all of the comforts of a great hotel. We rode bikes through a valley of green farmland to the village of Bai Sha and to the infamous Dr. Ho who has been credited with healing thousands of people in his 90 years. I received a quick eye scan from Dr. Ho who instantly pronounced Gerald interpreting) His ofï¬ce contains more than 50 pots filled with therapeutic plants and herbs that he gathers in the mountains. Dr. Ho will proudly show you a letter from the Mayo Clinic thanking him for healing a terminally ill cancer patient. I am convinced that if I return in 30 years a 120-year-old Dr. Ho will still be there smiling and healing. From Lijiang we took a stomach-turning drive through the mountains to Shangri-La or Zhongdian. An easyÂ hour-long hike through the stunning Tiger Leaping Gorge provided me with a much-needed break in the drive. These mountains are home to Khampa Tibetans and the area provides a look at Tibetan culture 13\,000 feet above sea level. Each morning from my room at the Songstam Retreat I awakened to views of the jagged snow-capped Himalaya. Gerald introduced me and my group to farmer friends of his in the town of Ringha who welcomed us in for cups of yak butter tea and to meet their new baby. A warning the tea is a hyper-local delicacy and makes you feel like you’re drinking a cup full of hot butter. Songzangling Monastery Annie Fitzsimmons. The hotel overlooks the 17th-century Songzangling Monastery home to hundreds of monks practicing Tibetan Buddhism. At the bustling monastery I toured colorful temples and meditation halls covered in murals. I was even blessed by a living Buddha very high-ranking lama in his prayer hall which kept me on cloud nine all week. As you make your 2012 travel wish lists I hope you consider adding this faraway corner of the globe. The Yunnan is woefully under-traveled with Westerners accounting for only 1 of visitors. This unusual and exotic journey felt like a well-kept secret until now. Fitzsimmons is a New York-based travel and hotel writer. She is a frequent contributor to publications that share her love of exploration and discovery. Follow her adventures on Twitter atÂ and on her personal blog\,Â Hotel Belle. I hope this unusual but beautiful part of the world stays this way and doesn’t become commercialised after you’ve let the secret out. Really enjoyed discovering the Yunnan Province with you.

If you saw the Super Bowl halftime show you probably wondered that guy in a toga bouncing crazily on a rope next to Madonna And howâ€TMs he doing it?â The guy was Andy Lewis a slacklining champion from California and he did it after many many years of practice. Slacklining is different from tightrope walking. Instead of a taut line itâ€TMs performed on inch-thick nylon webbing that stretches and bounces. That lets folks like Lewis aka Andy\,â defy gravity like a cartoon character. To find out more about it Pop Omnivore spoke with climbing legend Dean Potter who was featured in a recent National Geographic story on climbing and whoâ€TMs done a bit of slacklining himself. What is slacklining Slacklining started in the 1970s when climbers were walking on nylon rather than tightrope. It was more accessible for everyone because you could do it anywhere and itâ€TMs like walking on a one-inch trampoline. After that you just start grooving with the movement. How did you get into it I first learned slacklining in 1993 from a homeless man named Chongo Victor Tucker III. He had a line stretched between a blue Chevy van and a boulder and I walked it first try other passes have taken years and years. The line finds your weaknesses and you have to deal with a lot of emotions. It can become a major form of meditation You focus on nothingness yet it gives you everything. How do you feel when youâ€TMre on a line I would say I have extra emotion. But everything I do on the lineâ€”itâ€TMs not a battle or an overcoming but itâ€TMs a oneness. You become OK with the fear and the ground pulling at you. Why you do it I have no rules Iâ€TMm not limited by what others have done before and I just do whatâ€TMs natural for me. Remain calmâ€”everyone can relate to that. Donâ€TMt be restricted by convention and limited by fear. Iâ€TMve been practicing yoga my whole life. My mom was a yoga teacher and I started just absorbing by watching her. Everything I do is a mental discipline. Itâ€TMs not a sport so much as it is the art of walking lines. When did variations like trick lining start to emerge Variations on line walking have existed for thousands of years and people have always done tricks on the line. There are a few books on the history of line walking and you can see people doing back flips off the wires in old black-and-white pictures. What did you think of Andy Lewisâ€TMs Super Bowl performance Iâ€TMve been watching him since he started and he is at the utmost level. I was very impressed with his composure. What else should people know about slacklining Slacklining is considered more art than sport. For me itâ€TMs about making myself and the group Iâ€TMm with a part of the most beautiful nature painting. I like turning people on to this magical thing that they can do anywhere. Iâ€TMve taught 3-year-old kids and grandmothers to it. If you can walk you can walk a line. Any words of wisdom for newbies Thereâ€TMs something compelling about the simple act of walking a line. Although itâ€TMs such a simple exercise it takes all of your focus and coordination to stand on the line. Itâ€TMs hard for many people to have that same feeling in normal life. You have to ask yourself you have the natural desire?â You have to be OK with falling do it in a safe way and practiceâ€”it takes repetition. Matthew Ellis This is not really a slackline on a video theres no actual but a rope. This sport is so exciting and is really helpful in gaining balance working on core strength stabilizing muscles etc It is such a fun and easy sport to get into and the whole family can participate.

Economic success or failure by Jonathan Tourtellot. Third in a series of occasional blogs about the ever-changing quality of travel destinations around the worldâ€”about whatâ€TMs going on behind the scenes and how it affects the character of the places we care about. Hong Kong has more natural attractions than Ireland. Sweden is culturally richer than all of India. Eh. Welcome to the world of economic researchâ€”combined in reports that can be used to shape the places we love to visit. The business leaders and economists who gathered at the World Economic Forum recently in Davos Switzerland can find the data behind these startling comparisons in the Forumâ€TMs own 500-page Travel Tourism Competitiveness Report. To be sure the report is a massive piece of workâ€”wonky but fascinating stuff if youâ€TMve never looked at how the tourism industry thinks. The reportâ€TMs star feature is its ratings of national economies the Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Index. is money-speak for your company want to build a hotel there?â Of course the question behind the question then has to be we travelers show up and stay in it?â. And the winner is Presumably then the most competitive countries are the ones we would most enjoy visiting. So which is the best Of the 139 countries rated in 2011 Numero Uno the winner for the fourth year running is. Switzerland. Well OK. Switzerland is certainly pretty good. Itâ€TMs a beautiful country that takes excellent care of itself. Coincidentally of) itâ€TMs the home of Davos. Is it the most appealing nation on Earth Itâ€TMs not without wrinkles. The Swiss franc soared so high into the stratosphereâ€”at least until the Swiss tied it down to the euroâ€”that most people couldnâ€TMt afford visiting where an average restaurant meal for two could run $200. Not so competitive that. Otherwise though Switzerland is a reasonable winner. At the other end of the scale\,it’s no surprise either that impoverished refugee-laden Chad anchors the bottom at No. 139. The U.S. by the way comes in at a strong number 6 despite bombing out on ease-of-entry. try to get a visa.. But the Forumâ€TMs report contains some bizarre results too. The scores are a composite of 14 different categories each with its own sub-scores and they donâ€TMt always add up. How can this be The answer lies in the use of metricsâ€”that is the report relies on things you can count. The ranking system is based partly on CEO interview results but more heavily on a set of quantifiable indicators. Hong Kong for instance has a high percentage of its tiny land area under protection so it comes out looking greener than Ireland. New Zealandâ€TMs vulnerable island ecosystem records the worldâ€TMs highest rate of threatened speciesâ€”probably because New Zealand actually bothered to record themâ€”but that bad number knocks one of the worldâ€TMs most conservation-minded nations downward in the ranking. Why should we care Because governments and investors make decisions based in part on this report decisions that might improve a destination or ruin it. Stewardship or Ease of Business. For comparison look at the National Geographic rankings of destinations published annually in National Geographic Traveler from 2004 through 2010. We avoided quantifiable measuresâ€”how do you quantify scenic beauty or cultural integrity?â€”and based the surveys solely on hundreds of expert opinions as to each destinationâ€TMs condition. The results generated an Index of Destination Stewardship. The 2009 survey of destination stewardship National Geographc Traveler November/December. To be sure the purpose was different from the Davos research. We were looking at sustainability Davos at economics. But the two do relate. In the long run a place canâ€TMt succeed at one without the other. The National Geographic surveys polled opinions from experts with a stewardship bias. The Forum polls business executives presumably with an economic and profit bias. Legitimate perceptions from two different directions. The trouble begins when they conflict. A higher score in some Forum categories may actually hurt destination quality. Ease of business and competitive pricing for instance may mask lax environmental protection and free-fire zones for slapdash developers. Heavy cruise ship traffic and sprawling vacation subdivisions dampen stewardship scores but economic metrics like infrastructure may encourage that very overdevelopment. Tourism is known for fouling its own nest. The once destination spoils growing a rancid crust of asphalt and fast-food franchises. Quantify vs. Qualify Then there are the arithmetic issues. The report does assign Switzerland a bottom-hugging 127 in pricing competitiveness but cost-of-trip the decision-maker for many tourists apparently gets no more weight in the Index formula than any of the other 13 categories. While many numerical measures used by the report are fine some others are a bit weird. The Culture category counts history only in terms of a countryâ€TMs UNESCO-listed World Heritage sites. No other protected historic places or districtsâ€”too hard to find and quantify. No museums theaters and performance venues either. The researchers have tried but the data’s not there. What is easy to count Sport stadium seats No kidding. In Davos economics one-fifth of the weighting for a nationâ€TMs cultural-resource score is based on its stadium capacity. That might make sense in Texas but not in Italy. The Human Resources category includes several general-education measuresâ€”fineâ€”but no measure of local employment in tourism business such as tour guides innkeepers restaurant staffs. No reasonable way to get the data. But one factor the Index does count is um HIV prevalence. Just what sort of tourism are we assessing here. Those oddities are not necessarily the fault of the researchers who burned much late-night oil to get the huge report done. Indeed they welcome suggestions for better measures. Itâ€TMs more the framing of the task in the first place. For example quantitative data is usually tabulated by political jurisdictions. Deal with 139 of them and itâ€TMs virtually impossible to get meaningful comparisons against an international stew of varying definitions methods and accuracy. If statistically desperate youâ€TMre tempted to grab whatever data is available. To paraphrase an oft-forgotten observation The quantifiable is not necessarily meaningful nor is the meaningful always quantifiable. We donâ€TMt want economic and political leaders basing their decisions about our favorite destinations on a foundation of quantified mush. Probably travel and tourism hasnâ€TMt been foremost on the minds of the money-barons who gathered at Davos though it does constitute by most measures one of the worldâ€TMs top three industries.Â And a country that I personally love is foremost on their minds Greece. Gorgeous Greece has now become worrisomeÂ to visit. Its debt crisis is a black hole in the economic cosmos sucking in massive clouds of euros and hope. Are more protests more strikes to come. Greece scores a robust 29 out of 139 in tourism competitiveness. Go figure. Better yet Davos donâ€TMt figure. Evaluate instead. More insight and fewer numbers perhaps We count on you for wisdom that will protect the places we love.

The Masai Mara is a place of great beauty and drama where people and wildlife live side by side. While having a savannah full of wildlife on your doorstep seems amazing to us living with lions is never easy. With the generous support of the National Geographic Big Cats Initiative the Anne K. Taylor Fund team is helping to reduce the growing conflict between humans and wild animals by fortifying Maasai livestock enclosures or bomas with wire fencing. Anne and her team encourage and assist the local Maasai to be actively involved in conservation building a sense of trust through community work that includes building schools feeding children and introducing solar power. Building better bomas. Cattle along with shoats and goats) are the primary livelihood of the Maasai who value livestock above all else. The risk of retaliatory killings of marauding lions and other big predators is high when there is so much to lose. A traditional boma made of thorn trees is a frail defence against attack from predators who are hungry for their next meal or need to feed their family. Herders tell us that they are often forced to keep watch all night with the threat of wild animals lurking just outside the firelight. Fencing livestock enclosures with wire barriers keeps predators at bay and livestock safe from harm. Wire fencing provided by AKTF is used to fortify the boma with two-feet underground and six to ten-feet above. This prevents lions from pushing through leopards climbing over and honey badgers and hyenas digging underneath. Herders tell us that they can now sleep peacefully knowing that their livestock is being protected. At this time over two hundred bomas have been fortified and the wire fencing continues to be 100 successful in preventing predation when it has been installed properly. A leopard recently broke into an unprotected boma where it decimated a herd of shoats. In revenge Maasai warriors from the local village hunted down the leopard and shot it with a bow and arrow. Sadly this terrible loss on both sides could have been prevented if the boma had been fortified. The demand for chainlink fencing is growing by the day with an increasing amount of requests flooding in from Maasai livestock owners who have seen with their own eyes the effectiveness of building better bomas. Protection against poachers. The anti-poaching team are passionate about protecting the rich and diverse wildlife of the Masai Mara working against all odds to track down poachers remove snares and rescue trapped or injured wildlife from a slow and horrible death. While on patrol with Elias Kamande and his team we discovered a poacher camp filled with old bones and a recently slaughtered buffalo. The poor animal had been driven into a dry riverbed and speared to death. We quickly went in pursuit of the poachers but unfortunately they escaped into a nearby forest. Secured bomas provide better protection to wildlife. Elias tells us that poachers have been taking advantage of the heavy rains to hunt on foot while the anti-poaching team has been battling against terrible road conditions and knee-deep mud to help save wild animals from terrible injuries caused by snares arrows or spears. Walking back to the car we met a pair of big male lions prowling through the tall grass. With beating hearts we stood our ground but they soon moved off at the sight of us. It was breathtaking to be so close to these magnificent creatures in the wild an animal whose very existence is being threatened. A brighter future. It was a joy to visit the Oloomongi school and see all of the happy smiling faces of the Maasai children. Everyone wanted to be photographed and a crowd of eager students quickly surrounded us. The teachers tell us that the children are staying in school longer and getting better grades with the school lunch program as they are now able to focus on their study without feeling tired or hungry. The Insta porridge provides the energy and sustenance they need to make it through the day. The new classroom after much hard work and a few delays due to the heavy rain has been completed in time for the first term opening its doors to many more children who will have a brighter future through education. Power to the people. After sunset the Masai Mara is covered in a blanket of darkness except for the glowing of firelight from the inside of huts. Together with Solar Aid AKTF is bringing renewable energy to the Maasai using the power of the sun. So far solar systems have been installed in two schools allowing for longer hours evening classes and after-school study sessions. Solar power is also being used to set up income-generating activities to go towards textbooks classroom furniture and improving school buildings. There is a high demand for clean and affordable light in the homes of the surrounding Maasai villages with part of the profit from household solar going back into the feeding program at the school. Clean cooking Biofuel made out of cow dung is another energy-producing project that has everyone in the village talking. Rather than chopping down firewood the Maasai can produce biogas from the manure from their cows. This keeps the village or manyatta cleaner by recycling waste and is much more eco-friendly. The Maasai women tell us that using a gas cooker to prepare food and boil water saves them from having to walk long distances in search of firewood giving them more time to do other chores and look after their children. Getting a green thumb. The womenâ€TMs horticulture project involves sack gardens that are low cost easy to put together and simple to maintain with a little care. The vegetables grown this way add much-needed nutrition to the traditional Maasai diet of blood milk and meat. Planting in a sack prevents wildlife such as eland buffalo and impala from raiding the garden thereby decreasing the risk of revenge killings by poisoning or spearing. The Maasai women tell us that they can now feed their children without worrying that all their hard work will be destroyed. Conservation strategies also seek to educate and improve the lives of local children. Ultimately local people must benefit from healthy ecosystems. Cultural craftwork. The womenâ€TMs beading project led by Joseph Mpatiany and his wife Regina provides much-needed work and community support while following a tradition that has lasted for generations passed on from mother to daughter. Maasai women from different villages come together to make brightly coloured hand-beaded bracelets in intricate patterns. This beautiful beadwork is then sold to individuals and FEED projects which in turn feeds millions of children in Kenya and elsewhere through the UN World Food Programme. Yearn to learn. AKTF also conducts adult education classes including English mathematics and Kiswahili along with lessons on how to run a small business. Enoch Mobisa who runs the classes tells us that the teaching embraces the Maasai way of life while encouraging the community to adapt to modern-day Kenya. Care for the community. At the heart of all the wonderful work done by Anne and her team lies the importance of saving wildlife. The local lion pride has just welcomed a new litter of cubs that is heart-warming to see. Protecting livestock enclosures to prevent predation and the resultant retaliatory killings gives these lions a better chance of survival. Community support is essential for the success of the boma project which is why AKTF is so active in the local community. Working together with the Maasai is the only way to bring about real and lasting change and in doing so protect the big cats. Kate and Marcus Westberg work with theÂ Anne K. Taylor Fund.Â For more photographs and stories from Marcus Kate please visit www.lifethroughalens.org.Â Great to see the Initiative is working Very well written article.

Thanks to a close encounter with Venus skywatchers the next few nights get a chance to easily glimpse the 7th planet from the Sun the green giant Uranus. While the pair of planets will be visible together within the field of view of any standard 7×50 binocular until Feb.15th Venus and Uranus will have their closest encounter for 2012 on the 10th at 2:oo UT pm EST making it well positioned for North American observers in the evening of Feb.9th.Â The two worlds will only be separated by 0.3 degrees -Â less than the width of the moon’s disk in the sky. Shining at magnitude 5.9 Uranus is technically visible to the naked eye as a superfaint bluish star but that’s really only possible from very dark skies far from city lights. So what this means for most of us is that we need at least binoculars to catch sight of it. Through a small telescope under medium to high magnification it really looks distinctively like a bonafide planet with its tiny blue-green disk. By the way it’s the absorption of red light by methane in its atmosphere that gives Uranus it’s cool cyan coloring. Start your hunt by facing the west-southwest horizon at local dusk and zero-in on beacon like Venus the brightest starlike object in the evening sky. Then with your binoculars or a small telescope look for a tiny faint blue-green dot to the left of Venus. And remember if you do get clouded for the main show on the 9th then you can still catch the pair for a few days after as Venus quickly leaves behind the green planet rising higher in the western sky. First spotted in 1781 Uranus was the first new planet discovered since ancient times however it wasn’t until NASA’s Voyager 2 flew by in 1986 that we got an up close view at the third largest planet in the solar system 4 timesÂ the width of Earth. It’s so far away from the Sun that if you were a Uranian you would be lucky to celebrate your first birthday. A single year on this planet the time it takes to make one orbit around the Sun lasts just about a human lifespan 84 years. Sitting at a whopping 3.1 billion km from Earth Uranus great distance means that it takes the sun light reflecting off its upper cloud deck 2 hours and 52 minutes to reach your eye. Just a little something to think about when gazing at that tiny green dot in the sky. Skywatching Extra After about 9 pm local time on Feb.9th face the eastern horizon and watch the waning gibbous moon hang lower right of orange colored Mars. The cosmic duo will be 10 degrees apart -Â equal to the width of your fist held at arm’s length.

Others call this phenomenon zones that have no birds no monkeys no small mammals no snakes.. These places have been stripped bare by local communities that are struggling to feed their families and access medical care. The Mbuti pygmy encampments photographed in the early 1980s depict a wire and nylon-free lifestyle that saw them capture forest animals on a daily basis for local consumption. Today most of the bushmeat is exported to distant markets by bicycle 4×4 vehicles and on foot.Â No one has the right to judge these people when they focus on bushmeat as their only source of protein. We must however restrict use of forest products as far as possible to people with heritage rights to the land as they are the custodians of these forests. Terese and John Hart are committed to witnessing studying conserving and combatting the atrocities of the bushmeat trade in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Over the next few weeks I will post a series of summary posts linking back to their blogs on their website:Â http://www.bonoboincongo.com/.. It was not until 1929 that anatomists realized that there was an ape enough like the chimpanzee to be Pan but different enough to be a new species. Hart. Bushmeat Every Manâ€TMs Protein Until the Forest is Empty. In some of DR Congoâ€TMs most remote forest we are witnessing a cascading clean-out of large wildlife.Â It is like watching a cloud-shadow creep over the forest where it passes it leaves an invisible permanent absence.Â The edge is pushed forward by an advancing web of hunterâ€TMs paths crisscrossed with long snare lines a litter of shotgun cartridges and small leaf-shack hunting camps. Blue duiker caught in a nylon snare. This is a painful death.. Kuster Weapons abandoned by troops as they fled into the forest. Weapons from war zones are driving the bushmeat trade.. Hart. In 1997 we began an exploration and inventory of DRCongoâ€TMs least known interior forests Situated on the Congo Riverâ€TMs west bank and within the basins of the Tshuapa Lomami and Lualaba Rivers project. We set out to explore 40\,000 km2 but finding the perimeter forests already empty of large mammals we concentrated on the 20\,000 km2 interior forests At the end of 2011 the governors of two provinces signed their agreement for a national park within 9\,500 km2 of TL2â€TMs core area.Â TL2 landscape in Democratic Republic of Congo with its proposed national park and surrounding reserve. Hart. In August 2009 this bicycle transporter headed for Kindu has a goat chickens and rice all on two wheels.. Hart. Bushmeat market vendors and shoppers. There is so much superstition and prestige wrapped up in bushmeat that it will be hard to control.. Hart. Why a park Because the forest is still surprising rich containing. A previously unknown population of the great ape bonobo that only lives on the left bank of the Congo River http://www.bonoboincongo.com/the-bonobo/).Â This population of about 9000 bonobos is being hunted. An important remnant population of forest elephant with only 500-700 left and under constant poaching pressure. A rainforest giraffe endemic to DRCongo is also in TL2 and caught in snare traps. In fact all large mammals of the TL2 are under pressure.Â That includes 10 species of monkey\,Â including a new species is common name and two rare subspecies Cercopithecus mona elegans and Piliocolobus oustaleti parmentieri. Each of these three primate species is found in only a small area of forest and nowhere else. A traditional hunting camp of the Mbuti pygmies in the early 1980s. They set off daily for net hunts with nets made from the local forest liana they call Kusa. No nylon no wire. This kind of local consumption is sustainable.. Hart. Okapi at park headquarters in the RÃ©serve de Faune Okapi. Gjerstad. Elephant bones scattered on the floor of the Lomami forest show where poaching occurred. We found in the Ituri that such sites were often visited for years afterwards by surviving members of the elephant family. Hart. The forest of the soon-to-be Lomami National Park straddling three major river basins in Congoâ€TMs forested gut is rapidly becoming leaner.Â Will the animals be protected once the park is made A park is not automatic protection not even a park created with the agreement of local elders as is the case for the Lomami National Park. Protection is not easy.

Much ado has been made in recent headlines about growing scarcity on the Colorado River.Â Water supply as reflected by whatâ€TMs left in storage in the basinâ€TMs big reservoirs has dropped from full just over a decade ago to 64 today and the river hasnâ€TMt run regularly to the sea since the 90â€TMs. While some water users have the legal right to extract more water from the basin it is evident that by adding new demands to this over-used system we will create shortages somewhere else. The federal Bureau of Reclamation has started working with the seven states in the basin CA CO NM NV UT and WY to study the future of supply and demand on the Colorado and to search for solutions that fill the between them as illustrated in the right hand side of the graph above.Â Stay tuned for great debates about the merits of cloud seeding versus conservation and desalinization versus re-use. But what strikes me as most promising is the commitment from Reclamation and the states to consider the health of the basinâ€TMs rivers.Â Their latest report discusses how they will assess the future status of ecosystem health by looking at projected conditions for endangered species river-based wildlife refuges and even for a host of freshwater and riparian habitats on the mainstem and major tributaries. They draw the connection between the health of the river and the health of the economy not only by measuring how well consumptive water demands can be met in all sectors but also by discussing how theyâ€TMll measure future flows from the boaterâ€TMs perspective and how recreation-based economies may fare. That a study of the future of the Colorado should include the health of the river itself might seem obvious.Â Yet the vast system of pipes and canals weâ€TMve built from the top to the bottom of this basin point to the Coloradoâ€TMs central importance as a water supply to the arid Southwest and too often we overlook the river itself.Â How else can we explain the damage we have done to so many of the basinâ€TMs rivers over the last half century. The future of this region promises to be more crowded and likely hotter and drier but that doesnâ€TMt have to spell the death of the Colorado River.Â Reclamation and the states are facing the need to make decisions of great consequence about how to supply and manage water use in every sector.Â Letâ€TMs hope their new commitment to look at impacts on the river gives them the wisdom to forge a path forward that meets our legitimate water needs and protects and restores healthy flows.

Maldives leader Mohamed Nasheed called the most environmentally outspoken presidentâ because of his calls for drastically cutting greenhouse gas emissions wasÂ forced to resignâ€”at gunpoint he claimed. He had used stunts such as anÂ underwater cabinet meetingÂ to highlight his island nationâ€TMs vulnerability to sea-level rise. His resignationÂ followed weeks of protestsÂ and wasÂ apparently motivated by internal politicsÂ unrelated to his environmental views. Global Warming behind Europeâ€TMs Winter. Global warming could be behind the Arctic blast that recently hit Europe\,Â killing more than 200. The unusually small ice cover over theÂ Kara and Barents SeasÂ hasÂ changed wind patterns pushing frigid air into Europe. Meanwhile most of the U.S. has been enjoying anÂ especially mild winterâ€”although Alaska has had one of the coldest and snowiest on record and the Bering Seaâ€TMs ice grew to itsÂ second-highest on recordÂ in January. Meteorologist Jeffrey Masters said itâ€TMs not clear if global warming is the culprit behind the U.S. weather but over the last couple of years itâ€TMs reallyÂ not the atmosphere I know anymore.â. When theÂ Los Angeles TimesÂ reported on the warm winterÂ without mentioning the possible influence of global warming climate scientist Michael Mann called it malpractice.â. However the media is too often the scapegoat withÂ politicians and the economy having a bigger influenceÂ on public opinion about climate change according to a new study. Study Raises Greenhouse Gas Worries. A new study which sampled the air around sites where hydraulic fracturing is being used to extract natural gas from shale revealed more gasesâ€”mainly methaneâ€”escape into the air than previously thought. Although natural gas is usually touted as being better for the climate than other fossil fuels the study indicated these leaks couldÂ erase much of that benefit. Geoengineering Gets More Scrutiny. Tycoons including Bill Gates and Richard Branson haveÂ funded research and reports on geoengineeringâ€”proposed planetary-scale projects to fight climate changeâ€”raising concerns about the power of vested interests. Research into geoengineering is aÂ small butÂ fast-growing field. One recent study found that sunlight-blocking particles could cool the planet but would change regional climate patterns so wouldÂ not be able to keep the climate as it is now. Another recent study found that such geoengineeringÂ could help food productionÂ by limiting heat stress while retaining the boost in growth from higher CO2 levels. Wind Power Struggles Ahead. Wind turbine installations in 2011 wereÂ up 6 percentÂ over the year before a slight increase compared with the rapid growth before the 2008 recession. Less than half of the installations were in Europe or North America andÂ Asia led the growth. The worldâ€TMs largest turbine manufacturer Denmark-based Vestas Wind Systems has been flagging it lost $220 million in 2011â€”four times more than expectedâ€”and a number of senior officers left\,Â most recently the chairman. In the U.S. wind-power advocates have been fighting for offshore turbines along the Atlantic for decades and now the federal government is aiming toÂ speed permits after a positive environmental review. Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar said have those leasesÂ issued by the end of 2012.â. Hair Noâ€”But Grass Yes. Reports from a few years ago thatÂ Nepalese teenagers made a solar panel from hairÂ was apparently aÂ hoax but now MIT researchers have done something that seems equally unlikely makingÂ solar panels from grass clippings. TheÂ new studyÂ described how to fairly cheaply isolate a key part of the molecular machinery behind photosynthesis and then apply it to a metal or glass surface to create a photovoltaic panel. The researchers are trying to make it simple enough that anyone canÂ hack together a solar panelÂ using grass clippings and a bag of cheap chemical powder. The Climate PostÂ offers a rundown of the week in climate and energy news. It is produced each ThursdayÂ byÂ Duke Universityâ€TMs Nicholas Institute for Environmental Policy Solutions.

In a sweltering tin shed on the outskirts of Hanoi 20 Asiatic black bears pant with thirst and gaze with despair through cage bars as they await the next onslaught of bile-extraction agony. During this crude process they will be subdued tied down and will have long needles jabbed into their abdomens numerous times until the gall bladder is located and their bile extracted. Given that this is reportedly one of the more humane there may be the luxury of a portable ultrasound machine used to locate their gallbladder thus sparing them the random multiple needle jabs commonly used in the more and missâ method of bile extraction. Asiatic black bears or moon bears as they are known because of the distinctive yellow crescent-shaped marking on their chests produce bile with the highest amount of ursodeoxycholic acid It is thought that the bears produce the bile as a natural protection for their liver and to prevent gallstones and other illnesses during the long period of hibernation. The bile is reputed to cure everything from bruises to cancer and is notably regarded and consumed as a libido-enhancing tonic. This makes the bears and their bile a valuable business commodity and a target. Bear-bile farming is illegal in Vietnam and the Moon bear is listed internationally as a critically endangered species but this has not halted or even slowed the rampant trade. The bile sells for exorbitant amounts and that means for many Vietnamese giving up the bears they have trapped from the wild is not an option. For people such as Animals Asia Vietnam director Dr. Tuan Bendixsen the situation is untenable and his bid to save the bears has become his life’s work. The we visited as part of this documentary have had these 40 bears as for several years now. In 2007 when the Vietnamese government first introduced bear-keeping regulations those who had micro-chipped bears were allowed to keep them but had to abide by regulations that meant it was illegal to extract bile sell it or any other bear product. They could not advertise bile or bear products or engage in any other sort of trade. The process around these regulations is not upheld and that leaves all stakeholders in limbo. Bendixsen has been negotiating unsuccessfully for years with the owners of these bears appealing to have the bears surrendered so they can be taken to the purpose-built sanctuary at Tam Dao about two hourâ€TMs drive above Hanoi. The sanctuary provides a respite for abused and damaged bears rescued by Animals Asia from farms like this one. The Animals Asia Foundation is a not-for-profit organization and relies exclusively on donations and sponsorship. At present they have rescued close to 100 but there are still an estimated 4\,000 bears on farms throughout Vietnam trapped in cramped cages starved dehydrated and suffering repeated bile extractions. For most this is the only life they have ever known. Brendan McCarthy’s website. Another example of how misinformed citizens cause harm to endangered species...All across the world we see species being decimated to make medicines which actually do nothing to improve health.

But few outside the Society know little of the history that lies behind them. Until the early 1930s most of our maps were hand-Â letteredâ€”a slow and tedious process requiring great patience and even greater skill. An alternate processâ€”that of setting names in movable type pulling an impression on gummed paper that was then pasted down on the mapâ€”often yielded less than durable or clearly readable type. The Society’s first Chief Cartographer Albert H. Bumstead believed the answer lied in photo-graphic type. Laboring longÂ hours in his home workshop he discovered that existing typefaces did not lend themselves to Society standards our map enlargement and reduction factors often caused small hairline letters to break up while larger block letters tended to fill up. To this end he invented a machine for composing map type photographically that ultimately improved overall type legibility. Once this photolettering process was refined it was applied to our United States map supplement in the May 1933 National Geographic. Shortly thereafter Society cartographer Charles E. Riddiford was tasked with designing typefaces with much improved photomechanical reproductive qualities. He devised a set so attractive and legible that these typefaces are still used a digital format today. These patented fonts were designed with the purpose of reflecting as well as accentuating designated map features. If you study our reference maps and atlases closely itâ€TMs quite evident that every feature is asso ciatedÂ with a specific typeface. Color and typographic weight light to bold further adds to this distinction. Juan JosÃ ValdÃ©s The Geographer Director of Editorial and Research National Geographic Maps.

These people work hard out here the conservationists the farmers everyone.Â The hot days of October dictate an early rise to reach the far-flung locations that entail research data gathering and community outreach. Iâ€TMm in the central Kalahari region just outside the town of Ghanzi in Botswana.Â Itâ€TMs hot likeâ€ Africa hotâ€ as the clichÃ goes.Â Cheetah Conservation Botswana has a camp here where a small permanent staff of six and two volunteers reside as well as the giant guard dog Murphy and Cat a small orange house cat with a taste for murdering smaller creatures. Murphy after a roll in the mud on a hot day. In the night jackals can be heard and Murphy sets to barking his head off and growling at them.Â The jackal population has increased dramatically according to local Afrikaner farmers and as a result they are suffering losses of small livestock sheep and goat.Â This brings them into direct conflict with the predators in the region.Â If they hunt the jackal it could trigger a crisis in the pack and thus they will breed even more.Â So what are they supposed to do protect their flocks from intense losses. CCB Researcher Jane Horgan is working on just this issue.Â Livestock dogs such as our Murphy an Anatolian Shepherd local Botswana mix breeds and greyhound mixes are being tested at CCB Ghanzi camp and elsewhere as to their effectiveness in this particular climate of dry intense heat. Today Iâ€TMm in the car with Jane.Â Weâ€TMre in the ever-sturdy Toyota Hilux taking us over the bumpiest roads Iâ€TMve ever experienced. Driving through dust and fences. Being in the passenger seat means that Iâ€TMm on fence duty.Â Weâ€TMre in farmland game farms and livestock farms and that means gates and lots of I open and close nearly a dozen gates throughout the day.Â Some farmers work with CCB allowing them to study play trees on their land collect scat and set camera traps to analyze the cheetah population and its integral part in the ecosystem. We are checking trees on the Flatteryâ€TMs farm the term given to trees with low branches that cheetah love to scratch-mark spray and hang about.Â There is scat to collect and batteries in the motion sensor cameras to change.Â A lot of cheetah are in the area as evidenced by fresh scat and lots of fabulous self-portraits on the cameras.Â I may as well retire as a photographer the cheetah do it all on theyâ€TMre own with compositional style and finesse. image on loan from Cheetah Conservation Botswana. As we finish with the last marking tree we drive past the main farmhouse where brothers Melcomb and Quinton are sitting under a shady umbrella having a rest.Â We get out to chat and catch up.Â The farmhouse is a lovely set of small buildings gardens and cages with exotic birds a few meerkats three exuberant dogs \,and somewhere lurking about is a pet mongoose. Melcomb and Quinton kindly agree to a video interview and go into great detail about their relationship with the predators on their land. Melcomb Quinton on the quad bike in search of the sheep carcass. As we talk Quinton looks over my head and into the distance.Â Then Melcomb does the same.Â What is it?Â Vulture.Â Seconds later more vultures circling in the distant sky.Â They know something is up their sheep are in that direction.Â Quinton sets off on the quad bike to have a look.Â Minutes later he radios his brother a sheep has been killed. Jane and I jump in the truck and follow the brothers into the bush to find the sheep. After a few minutes of looking around in the thick bush the unmistakable sound of thousands of swarming flies lead us to a ravaged sheep carcass.Â Although it is a fresh kill from that morning there is not much left of it.Â Quinton says itâ€TMs the work of three jackals that killed another sheep just days before.Â Jane Melcomb and Quinton point out the tell-tale signs of a jackal kill specific bite marks and methods of taking down prey. An air of resignation takes hold of the scene. taking a look at the evidence. I ask Melcomb if he will hunt the jackals.Â he answers.Â Quinton throws the carcass into a nearby tree so the hyenas canâ€TMt get to it come back looking for more thereby creating a bigger problem. What was a fairly relaxed chat about human-predator relations turned into a visceral example of the harsh realities of being a farmer in Botswana. But there are solutions that can mitigate losses.Â Namely livestock dogs for smaller animals such as goats sheep and calves. Melcomb Quinton and Jane talk in earnest about getting a dog to guard the sheep.Â With more jackals in the area there are more mouths to feed.Â Itâ€TMs important to take a stronger action.Â Iâ€TMm new to this topic listen with an open mind and wonder about the efforts of hunting and energy expended considering all the work basic farming involves vs. livestock guard dog solutions. The Flatterys have been working this land for three generations and they are curious about new methods but they also have a farm to run and new methods take time.Â Building strong relationships with the farmers who already allow CCB to set up motion capture cameras on play trees in their area is a key factor. Murphy in the bush at sunset. We return to the shady spot under the umbrella have a slice of cake and a soda play with the pet mongoose and chat about wildlife and old stories of the days when the water table was higher there were no fences when the cattleâ€TMs drives were on horseback before setting off to return to cheetah camp.

Tagged as 3 comments.. read them below or add one How disappointing I would have been upset if I hadn’t gotten this book for free. It is NOT a book of swashbuckling fantasy each entry is a short sample of a much longer piece. If you just want to sample to see if a piece is interesting then this might appeal to you. Was this review helpful to you?Â Log in to Reply. I am NOT a fan of samples. So with that said when I read in the description that it was a sampling of 10 series from good authors I almost passed it by. But then I thought it’s free and why not. I have been finishing some series that I have loved but they have come to an end and I have been looking for new ones to start. So for me this was neat because I got a few chapters of 10 stories to see if I liked and for free.. Although most I had heard of the first one of Jolly was new to me. I didn’t think I would really like it being that the only seeming thing for her was she could run or walk on water. But the pirate theme got to me and I enjoyed it. Being able to jump into multiple series and see the different writing styles perspectives storylines\,and plots was nice and made for a good read. Although I didn’t get excited about any of them in particular I liked looking at them as short stories.. All in all it was a pleasant read and for anyone shopping for new series then I would definitely recommend. The 10 included are:\1. The Wave Walkers Pirate Curse by Kai Meyer\2. Shadow Children Among the Free by Margaret Haddix\3. Leven Thumps Leven Thumps and the Gateway of Foo by Obert Skye\4. The Ratbridge Chronicles Vol 1 Here Be Monsters by Alan Snow\5. The Cronus Chronicles Book 1 The Shadow Thieves by Anne Ursu\6. Gideon the Cutpurse by Linda Buckley-Archer\7. Pendragon Book 7 The Quillan Games by D. J. MacHale\8. The Eidolon CHronicles Book 1 The Secret Country by Jane Johnson\9. Uglies by Scott Westerfield\10. Valiant A Modern Tale of Faerie by Holly Black. Was this review helpful to you?Â Log in to Reply. Many free Kindle books are awesome. Not this one. I got this in paperback form from our bookstore a year or so ago. You don’t get 10 stories you get mediocre previews of 10 books.

These clamps are sturdy and handle heavy volume with no problems. Ignore any other comments claiming that these are cheap or poorly made. I am a portrait photographer and am constantly taking backdrops down and putting them up before and during a shoot. These clamps have never slipped or broken even though I usually attach and reattach them quickly during shoots. They ARE plastic but it is a strong and rugged type of plastic that won’t break if used correctly. In addition the orange do an excellent job of assuring grip. The price is right as well. Buy them already and worry about more important things. Was this review helpful to you?Â I’m ordering my second batch because they are so handy I’m a photographer and I don’t really use them to hold up muslin but I have a lot of paper backdrops and I use them to keep the rolls tight for storage they don’t ruin the paper. Also I use the clamps to hold these backdrops to foam boards and my backdrop stand. Normal metal clams indent the foam board and ruin these drops. I use them all the time to clamp anything shears to a curtain rod...again they are very very handy to have around. Was this review helpful to you?Â They work well and are priced accordingly. Compact. Strong grip. Recommended for grasping pipe sizes from 3/4 inch to 1 1/4 inches in diameter. Tips of clamp adapt to create nice a grip on flat object. Cheap enough that if you lose them you just buy another pack. I ordered 6 packs just because I’m always losing these things. Was this review helpful to you?Â You must be logged in to post a comment.

Fortunately I haven’t had to test them yet but whenever I have used them I’ve felt that my eyes were very well protected. I mainly got these because they were inexpensive and fit over my glasses can’t see much without my glasses and I need them on for the machine shop work for which I purchased this product).. My only real complaint is that they don’t have any venting as a result after not-that-lengthy periods of use they tend to fog up inside. This is easily fixed by taking them off briefly and perhaps wiping down the inside. It’s just somewhat annoying to have to stop what I’m doing every 15 minutes or so to de-fog. Was this review helpful to you?Â I work in a chemistry lab and wear goggles anywhere from four to twelve hours a day five to six days a week. Common splash goggles become uncomfortable after a few hours so I decided to try a few better quality goggles. I wear glasses.. On the plus side these AO Safety goggles are comfortable. The single-piece lens is flexible and exhibits very little distortion. The goggles readily conform to the face make a good seal and are plush. The strap appears durable. On the minus side the lens is tinted the goggles are heavy the lens pushes against my glasses and they emit a horrific odor.. Although the lens is obviously high quality it is tinted. The tinting is subtle but became more obvious as time went by. The goggles are obviously intended for working in a chemical hazard environment. Most such environments are indoors so there’s really no logic to the tint. It’s not dark enough for full sun protection and diminishes the apparent indoor light.. Compared to other goggles they are heavy. The strap keeps them well positioned as does the seal they make to the face. But after a few hours of wear they become wearisome from the weight pulling on the face.. The goggles ability to conform to the face makes them unsuitable for glasses wearers. The edges of the goggles take a sharp turn around the temples. The arms of my glasses contact the lens forcing the glasses into the bridge of my nose I don’t have big glasses. There are cut outs for the arms of glasses which are readily removed with an hobby knife.. These glasses stink. After removing the goggles I could smell the chemicals that leached from their manufacture. This odor remained with me for two to three hours. Whatever is causing the odor cannot be good for the health. Also as a chemist odors are one clue that something bad is in the air. Since the odor from the goggles was so overpowering the inability to smell lab chemicals is a safety hazard.. I cannot say whether or not they are fog proof or fog resistant. The lab is kept air-conditioned. I can see why some occasional goggle users would like these especially if the use is for periods less than one hour. For full-time lab workers they are not suitable. Was this review helpful to you?Â The goggle works great as described and as it’s intended to be used. The lenses are 100 anti-fog that is for sure but ventilation is bad. 2 minutes and my prescription glasses would fog up and I’d have to remove the goggle for 5 seconds to get clear visibility and this is why I rated it 4. It’s NOT comfy as not wearing that’s for sure but this is what you get for a well-secure goggle can be improved. Overall as an amateur I’m very glad about this product.

The biggest contributing factor for me purchasing this particular clicker was because it states it can be clicked from nearly any position. In the times I’ve used it so far that is always the case. It is very easy to hold in my hand only 5’1′ and have small hands for an average female and click in my palm. It is the perfect loudness for my two cats even though one typically does not like sudden noises. I like that this clicker has a section on the end for a key chain or string if you choose to use one. Thus far I find no negatives about this clicker. Was this review helpful to you?Â I had this and it was a good investment for dog training. If it doesn’t work you are probably the one to blame this does what it was made to do MARK THE BEHAVIOR. Was this review helpful to you?Â This clicker was too quiet for my use.

This set contains all 12 of Aerosmith’s early Columbia releases–7 studio albums 3 live ones an early Greatest Hits and the album which I guess is another anthology. For many fans of their newer music few of these tracks will be recognizable maybe only a few from the Greatest hits. Still this is a great way to discover Aerosmith at their height. Besides the 12 original albums this set includes a 5-track bonus disc most notable for its rockin rendition of Emotion and the absolutely beautiful version of On a symphony!. These are two excellent remakes of a couple of Aerosmith’s best songs. The great thing about this set is that all the old albums appear exactly as they originally did they’ve been remastered. You don’t have to worry about song selection because it’s all here. So for anyone wanting to start a good Aerosmith collection this is the absolute best place to start. This box set is highly recommended. Don’t let the high price tag fool you–it’s well worth every penny.

These are two excellent remakes of a couple of Aerosmith’s best songs. The great thing about this set is that all the old albums appear exactly as they originally did they’ve been remastered.

This box set is highly recommended. Don’t let the high price tag fool you–it’s well worth every penny. Was this review helpful to you?Â A lot of other reviewers here seem clueless as to why this box set was released the way it was. Some history might clear this up. Aerosmith first signed with Columbia records in 1972. Then in the mid 1980s they cleaned up their drug habits and switched labels to Geffen records. After having quite a successful come-back they then went back to Columbia records in 1994. What does this have to do with the box set Well you have to realize that in the music industry the release of compilations box sets and even just re-releases of older albums is all largely determined by a band’s record label. A record label obviously isn’t going to make money off of an album put out by another label. This means that when a band releases a lot of albums under one record label but then leaves them for a new label each label will handle things with their own best interest in mind. For example the old stuff might get acquired and re-released on by the new label or the band will try to finish off their old contract by releasing a compilation album etc. It’s no coincidence then that when Aerosmith joined back with Columbia in 1994 the label decided to re-release all 12 albums that they had done for Aerosmith. In addition to selling them separately they also decided to put all 12 discs in this box set of Fire. So this box set simply contains all 12 individual Aerosmith albums that had been released up until then with Columbia records plus a bonus EP of rarities. This means you will NOT find anything from the albums Aerosmith did with Geffen. That means nothing from With Mirrors” Vacation” or a Grip. If you’re looking for a compilation of the hit songs from those years try Ones” which Geffen released in the same year. But here is what you WILL find in of Fire”. DISCS 1-7 Aerosmith’s 7 albums from the 1970s. Your Wings” in the Attic” the Line” the Bootleg live album and in the Ruts. DISC 8 Hits” a compilation spanning the 1970s albums released in 1980. DISC 9 The 1982 album in a Hard Place. This was made without Joe Perry and is often considered the black sheep album of Aerosmith’s career. Personally I love it. DISCS 10-11 Live!. and Live II. These were two live compilation albums that Columbia released while Aerosmith was still making new albums with Geffen. The first is a collection of 1977-1983 recordings with the bonus non-album track Barbara. Classics II consists of live recordings from the mid-80s after Aerosmith reunited with Joe Perry. DISC 12 another album that Columbia released while Aerosmith was already with Geffen to cash-in on the band’s return of popularity again was due to the hits they were releasing from Geffen albums like Vacation and It was released in 1988 and is essentially a Hits volume II from the Columbia years. I remember it being quite popular because it was not only a cheap way for new Aerosmith fans to get some of their older stuff but it was the only disc on which you could get the studio version of Away at the Stone” a 1978 single that was never released as a track on a full album before. DISC 13 This is a bonus EP with five tracks. There’s a 1991 edit of Emotion” which Columbia used in the music video to promote the Box box set yet ANOTHER thing they released while Aerosmith was having success with Geffen records. Also here is the live orchestral version of On that the band did for an Mtv special and also released on the Action Hero soundtrack. The other tree tracks are Jerk ghost track from Box” and two other songs that you won’t find anywhere else. Some people are complaining about the redundant tracks or the fact that you could use less discs to fit the same music. Again this is a re-release of the 12 individual Aerosmith albums that were being sold individually anyway and they’re being sold all together here as a collector’s set. They’re going for completeness. So who would want to buy this entire box set Especially since you admittedly have some redundant tracks here with Hits” etc. If you’re just a casual fan then by all means stick with the much cheaper Box box set which Columbia released in 1991. On the other hand if you don’t have much Aerosmith on CD then this is the best way to get all of the old stuff in one purchase at one low price. That was certainly the case for many of us back in 1994 when a lot of us only had Aerosmith on vinyl or cassette and wanted a good CD replacement. Likewise if you’re a die-hard fan who wants a complete collection including those rarities then.. Read more. Was this review helpful to you?Â By far the most comprehensive Aerosmith collection available. Box of Fire includes all of the band’s Columbia albums with the exception of of course Nine Lives and even adds a 5 cd bonus disc. The discs come remastered and with extensive linear notes. The only drawback to this excellent box set is the price. At around $100 it is too much for most listeners but for those who are loaded you should definately get this collection especially if you don’t already own these albums. If you do though you will almost certainly want to pass as there is nothing new here outside the five songs which you have probably already heard and maybe even own three and the box itself.

I have been a Chicago Tribune subscriber for 10 years. I wanted to get the Tribune on the Kindle for a number of reasons paper to deal with ease of delivery etc.. While I’m very glad the Tribune is now available on the Kindle there is certainly room for improvement.. The Kindle version of the Tribune is simply a of the Tribune articles. For the most part this is fine the reader gets all of the content graphs charts comics crossword puzzle of the print edition. However there are a number of flaws that haven’t been corrected yet including:\ Most columns do not have a byline after being told this would be corrected it isn’t 100%)\ Accompanying articles are out of order\ General formatting lists)\ Occasionally items are clearly missing are 5 items ... and then the 5 items are missing)\ US/World blurbs do not identify the state or country. It’s clear the formatting of the Kindle edition of the Tribune needs some work the Tribune needs to understand how the reader views the articles and format them accordingly. A simple from the print edition isn’t sufficient additional formatting is necessary.. I have subscribed to the Chicago Tribune Kindle edition since it was first offered and it has improved. Here’s hoping that the Tribune continues these improvements to make the Kindle edition something worth my continued subscription. Was this review helpful to you?Â Well the Tribune finally has photos. They’re kind of nice to have even if they make the file 5-10 times bigger hassle if you’re in a war zone with crappy internet access. The thing is since they now include graphics for the news stories there really isn’t any reason not to include comics as well. I can get the Tribune online for the same price with the comics included but the file is 5-10 times even larger than it is now. Again only a problem where I’m at but even when I’m home I don’t carry a laptop with me everywhere as I can and do with the Kindle.. For those who are wondering why I’m going on about the comics look the paper edition home delivery is the same price as the online and Kindle editions. If you’re not going to include certain features on the Kindle edition you should make the price much cheaper. I don’t read the paper just for the comics but if I’m going to pay for them I’d certainly like to have them available. And now there is no reason not to include them. Was this review helpful to you?Â What you get .. Tons of articles. No pictures comics or puzzles. But then again.. are you really reading the paper for a pictures and puzzles?. Seriously??. I’m happy to have all of my content included. I’m up to date on the news right on time. I’m usually up and ready to read the paper by 6:30a. I’m not sure how early anyone who has not gotten their paper on time gets up... I’m from Chicago. I like that how the Trib has a nice balance of local news and national news. The stories are well written of the time. I’d like to say it’s pretty open minded for a newspaper. I don’t really agree with everything. and sometimes I want more info. But that’s news right It’s a fresh opinion before all the facts are out.. I also noticed that a lot of the bad reviews are kind of dated. Perhaps they’ve perfected their system That’s a good sign...

Bought this set sight unseen to sit on our kitchen table because the screen size seemed ideal and it is The picture’s fine as you would expect of an HDTV. Set-up was delayed because our cable end was not flexible enough to make the short right turn over the stand and into the set from the bottom. After many unsuccessful attempts to attach I bought a five dollar 90 degree cable adapter from Radio Shack and that made the connection easy. My cable is u-verse rather than basic so I found the manual directions for setting up cable channels did not work. Instead I set up to detect and store the regular TV channels and the u-verse channels could then be found on channel three and changed with the cable zapper. My cable remote could not come up with the code for the new set so I called the support number on the manual and e-mailed the support site twice each leaving messages asking for the four digit code to the remote. Never got a response. If anyone knows it please mention it in a review at this site I’d appreciate it Until then we’ve got the channels on the cable zapper and the volume on the TV remote. The DVD did not work using the direction in the manual to face the label toward the front of the set. We found an arrow on the side of the TV positioned the DVD label toward the back of the set and it works I hope the earlier reviewer whose DVD wasn’t working finds this and tries it. The sound of this TV is very weak and thin like that of an old small transistor radio. Half the people on it sounded like they had lisps there was so much buzz even with treble turned way down with the equalizer. I added a cheap pair of speakers because of their small size and USB power and the improvement was huge The speakers attach to the earphone jack only audio out and the USB connection at the bottom of the set. It took a lot of re-rigging but we’re finally pretty happy with the set. Was this review helpful to you?Â This television was a big disappointment. Bad picture bad sound bad controls. We returned the television and are very pleased with Amazon’s return policies. Was this review helpful to you?Â I did my homework on these units. There are not many of these under counter all in one tvs left. So my score is in comparison to what is out there. Pros\*	Big screen this is a nice feature as most units have much smaller screens\*	Plays DVDs I have no problems with this feature\*	Has good reception All my channels come in fairly good TV/FM/AM)\*	Cheapest of all units with this screen size. *	Magnetic remote for the fridge. I have heard people complain about this feature because it is not strong enough to hold the remote up. I am guessing that is because they have a stainless steel fridge which has less magnetic for the most part in comparison to a standard metal finish. Cons\*	Picture quality is not so great. I think this is because of the slow response time of the screen. I also noticed that the picture was much better when a HD signal was present. presets is difficult. This is by far the biggest issue for me. It is not easy to select your favorite channels. I have also noticed that selecting presets is done differently between the tv and the radio. *	When the timer is on I have not figured out a way to see it count down. So until it goes off you have no idea how much time is left. *	Remote does not make it across the room. I tested it and it goes about 10 feet. In reality how much farther will you view a 15 inch screen from really need the remote to use this unit. I am sure there is a way to use the buttons on the unit but the remote is much easier. I Wish they would have done preselects on the unit.. Summary\Not a bad unit but if picture is important to you then this is not the unit for you. I am not sure the other units are any better in fact most of these units look to come from the same design. I assume they have updated the screen for vendors like RCA but not sure. IF you are looking for a simple inexpensive unit that has a big screen then it is not a bad option. I have had the unit for 2 months and no problems yet.

No problems so far and have been using it about 6 weeks. I shopped and this was the best choice I could find for a TV/DVD/CD combo. Sound is loud enough although it could be a little higher fidelity when using as a CD player. It’s a trade off worth making to be able to save the space and have a screen you can actually see from more than a foot away. I recommend it. Was this review helpful to you?Â this replaced a slightly larger screen my sons insisted on twisting everytime the went to the kitchen table.. every 2 or 3 days I’d have to push it back to protect it from falling onto the floor.. The Venturer screen is the largest I’ve seen. The 270 degree swivel means it can go to either side.. even though it turned opposite the way we usually watch it getting it face on to the table left of the screen as we look at it from the front is no problem. Picture quality and sound are great. DVD is built in works without problem.. I have only 2 even minor issues:\1st.. CAUTION when installing.. our cabinet was shallow enough there was nearly not enough room to fix it in place.. I had to drill a 2nd set of holes 1/2′ forward of where the paper template said holes should be drilled so PUT THE UNIT UP BEFORE YOU DRILL TO MAKE SURE IT FITS!!!. 2nd.. the remote IR sensor is at the front of the unit.. including when the screen is turned left or right. We have at times found it impossible to change the station or volume from where we were sitting.. a mirror on the fridge has helped in our case.. All in all it was a great investment.. saves us counter space is better protected than the set it replaced went up without a real hitch of significance.

I just love this cover that little red and yellow micro bus just calls out in and let’s go find an adventure’!. When younger more adventurous or those seeking a different agenda for their trip come into the library looking for travel books I try to put a Guide in their hands. Why?. From editor James Smart:. we started writing Rough Guides we wanted to share the kind of travel we had been doing ourselves. We wanted to push travel a bit further inspiring our readers to get away from the established routes even if that meant getting lost occasionally and seek something that little bit more special and authentic in short to settle for nothing less than an ultimate travel experience.”. Well Make the Most of Your Time on Earth has detailed 1000 of those unique travel experiences. Thirty years of Rough Guide writers personal recommendations are included with 200 new additions in this 2nd edition. And indeed the world is covered!. I’ve been reading this book off and on for a couple of months now. The fold out front cover has a colour coded legend to the geographical areas. The bottom right corner of the pages have that same colour block allowing you to flip quickly to a certain section. A map begins every section must admit I read in no particular order I just jumped to whatever grabbed my interest. Full colour photographs punctuate the descriptions. The writing style is informal and breezy reflecting the overall tone of the book. Each chapter ends with a Need to Know page that includes phone numbers and web addresses for the attractions listed. A Good to Know page includes general facts about that particular region as well as interesting notes about etiquette quotes and odd facts. only one country in the world with a three dollar bill answer at the end of the post!). The focus of each experience can vary greatly. Sometimes it’s the scenery the culture wildlife nightlife festivals sport food adventures and the unusual. Booklovers might want to visit Hay-on-Wye in Wales where the ratio of bookstores to humans is 40:1 It’s been estimated that there are over a million books in this tiny town. I discovered countries I had not heard of before. The smallest nation in Africa is Sao Tome and Principe home to some of the best chocolate beans the world produces. I was thrilled to see that I had done many of the things listed in the Canadian section I’ve skated on the Rideau Canal been to the Calgary Stampede cruised Georgian Bay seen Niagara Falls many times and a few more. I’m hoping to travel to the East Coast this year and there were lots of suggestions for that side of the country.. There was just so much to see and read about. Our world truly is amazing. Make the Most of Your Time on Earth does a fantastic job of showcasing 1000 things to see and do. Great reading for the avid traveller armchair or otherwise.. three dollar bill Found only in Roratonga!). Help other customers find the most helpful reviewsÂ Was this review helpful to you?Â Was this review helpful to you?Â I love this book I got it as a present and think it is a great starting point for my future adventures. There is a lot of information here and it is broken up both by region of the world and by the activity in that region. Keep in mind that this book doesn’t specifically say to Belize and do this through this company and here’s their website. Instead it is the authors talking about the most amazing experiences they have had and you are going to have to do the leg work of researching the destination plane tickets travel companies etc. This isn’t an all-inclusive guide that tells you exactly what to do it is more of a jumping off point to see which adventures pique your interest and going from there. Was this review helpful to you?Â This book is great Lots of wonderful pictures. It gives a place and then a short 1 page of information about that place. It’s enough to tweak your interest and see if that will be a future travel destination. Was this review helpful to you?Â You must be logged in to post a comment. Enter your email address.

I recently bought this paintball mask and i read a lot of reviews on it before i bought it some people said it fogged and some said it didn’t some don’t like to look of the mask or other petty personal opinion dislikes. I am writing this review on the performance of the mask only not the looks. I live in St.Louis and it is a very muggy humid city the first day I used this mask it was over 90 degrees and very humid and I was playing woodsball and doing a lot of running and sliding and dodging. first I would like to say that this mask DID NOT FOG AT ALL I am 28 years old and i wear glasses and this mask was comfortable and felt nice I almost didn’t even know I was wearing it I had no problems with any features of this mask AT ALL. Bottom line this is an all around GREAT mask and I would recommend it to anyone that is looking for a great mask that fits good fits very good over glasses you trim the foam it fits better then if you don’t looks good does not fog and doesn’t cost an arm and a leg so in short BUY THIS MASK!. Its AWESOME!!!!. Help other customers find the most helpful reviewsÂ Was this review helpful to you?Â Was this review helpful to you?Â I used to rent the goggles at the fields but WOW buying your own pair is DEFINITELY worth the money when you have people shooting at you and you can SEE them priceless. goggles have a large viewable range on the lens and it doesn’t fog up very easy at all. It is comfortable and has proven its durability. a beginner these are perfect. Was this review helpful to you?Â pros flexible durable hard plastic. excellent view with no fogging.. cons the foam pinches the nose a little bit so i basically have to breathe through my mouth. need to find a way to fix that. Was this review helpful to you?Â The standard tippmann A-5 is big and bulky and is hard to see around when shooting and usually the biggest thing that gets shot at other than your head. The low profile hopper is great because it eliminates both of those problems it’s rectangular in shape and sits way lower to the gun unblocking your iron sights. it also holds the same amount as the stock hopper maybe even a couple more. this hopper is great if your looking to be more efficient on the battle feild and if you want your gun to look good. Was this review helpful to you?Â This came with my A5. In comparison to a standard gravity hopper this thing is awesome!. Your marker actually feels like a gun without a bulky plastic thing on top. Very durable and rugged. The mouth is wide and the lid stays on securely. The low profile greatly reduces exposure during play. I love it!. Was this review helpful to you?Â Im going all milsim so when I saw this bad boy i couldnt resist. I got the tippman cyclone feeder so i could use this i didnt kno the cyclone feeder came with a hopper from tippman but comparing this hopper to the tippman one...this one looks alot more sexy. Only reason i didnt give it 5 stars is because the lid doesnt snap open just kind of floats open but its no big deal. I dont think this is an actual Tippman hopper but still its really a good deal.

If you’re one of those people who snort when you laugh don’t read this in public. You’ll completely embarrass yourself. The fresher Twilight is in your mind the funnier this book will be. Was this review helpful to you?Â We have both Twilight lovers and haters in the family. All thought this was laugh-out-loud funny ROFL if you are my daughter. The dry humor totally nailed everything in Twilight that deserved to be poked fun at. Never thought there’d be any piece of literature that would make both my wife and daughter laugh over a book they had totally opposite opinions about so I read it too. Even I could not put it down...and I’d only seen the movie voluntarily). Was this review helpful to you?Â In my view this doesn’t even qualify as a parody What it is is a blow-by-blow summary of Twilight in which the author doesn’t bother trying to mimic Stephenie Meyer’s style but merely removes almost all dialogue and descriptions of Edward’s unearthly beauty comprising most of the original work to make room for many repetitive snarky remarks on character behavior and commentary that makes Bella more overtly self-centered. I will admit that some of these remarks were right on but the fourth or fifth time I read a sentence like watches me sleep Cool right?. there are a lot of them) I’d pretty much had it. There are no new character directions in the story no attempts to add any unique details. Two stars because it only takes about 1/10 as long to get through this as it takes for Twilight.

NBA Top 10 Plays From Tuesday February 7th. Kobe Bryant An NBA Scoring Legend. Top Rated. Last night after Mitt Romney won the primary in Florida he did what politicians always do. As he waves to the crowd with his family in tow a patriotic song swells in the background. As Mitt’s photographic moment played out the song playing was K’naan’s Flag.. It turns out that Romney’s camp did not get approval from the rapper to turn the 2009 anthem into his campaign theme song. The Somalian-Canadian MC turned to twitter to let his thoughts be heard. I am K’naan Warsame and I do not endorse this message\, the rapper tweeted. In a statement released today K’naan elaborated that he was offended by the use of the song and does not endorse the candidate in any way. Warsame and his legal team are currently exploring their options in order to prevent Romney from further using the song during his campaign to become the Republican candidate for president. I had been asked I would certainly not have granted it\, The Troubadour explained.Â would happily grant the Obama campaign use of my song without prejudice.â. K’naan released his More Beautiful Than Silence EP last week. Props to Hip Hop Wired. Freelance Writer/Blogger/Radio Host residing in Atlanta GA. Check me out on Creative Loafing's Crib Notes blog.

Website Blog Recent Posts. Archives. Categories. Search. company services resources press latest tweets. connect Skip to Content. 8 2012 by Rebecca Price am a blogger copywriter and Social Media maven clawing her way towards making her passion a career. I’m also widely known as an early adopter of new Social platforms many online accounts do you have?. is a frequent question I get) an internet enthusiast fanatic of food trucks wearer of chanclas geeky over technology. I share it all over the web as well as on my blog Tacos y Gatos!. How You Can Find Trina. My Website. My Facebook. My Twitter. Which Social sites do you visit every single day. Most definitely Twitter Facebook Tumblr Instagram Flickr and Foursquare. Everything else just depends on what kind of day it is.. I happen to know you as a particularly early adopter in the tech world. You seem to always be just ahead of the newest trends. What are you particularly proud to have been early on Is there anything you adopted too late. Iâ€TMm particularly proud of being an early adopter of Flickr. My friend sent me an invite and since 2004 Iâ€TMve been a fan. To say it fueled my love and inspiration in photography at the young age of 22 would be an accurate statement. I would say I was late joining the Facebook crowd. I didnâ€TMt open that account until a year and a half ago. I just didnâ€TMt understand why people would talk to their friends there rather than text call or see them. Once I realized that I was able to keep in contact with my family in Mexico lucky if I see them at least once a year!). I was pretty much on board. What are your predictions about Google and Chime.in Do you think theyâ€TMll stick around or prove to be just passing trends How often do you get on both. I see the potential each platform carries. I would say that if you havenâ€TMt experienced Twitter or Facebook previously one could very easily prefer these over the others. But once you have a taste preference for a service itâ€TMs hard to leave that shell and move into something new. Iâ€TMm a curious being and I love finding new services that may just convince me otherwise. Unfortunately Chime.in didnâ€TMt do anything for me that I wasnâ€TMt already getting from twitter so I hardly if ever visit the site unless someone mentions me. As for Google+ I try to log on every day and scope the scene. Iâ€TMm starting to see the growth and have high hopes for it. My family is starting to join the G bandwagon so weâ€TMll see where it goes. What is your favorite thing about Social Media. More than anything the people you meet and connections you make. I have friends in Malaysia Singapore India Canada and of course Mexico. I love learning about their cultures their surroundings and teaching them my own. I also love meeting the locals. I love how you can basically go as far deep as the person lets you into their lives. I love the ability to share my own life because Iâ€TMm pretty much an open book. I love using it as a tool to express myself to learn from others and hopefully be informational and funny along the way. Overall I just love how easy it is to be in oneâ€TMs life especially when youâ€TMre so far apart. Dare I mention I met my husband of six years via Social Media Thanks MySpace. Tell me about your blog. Tacosygatos is a WordPress siteÂ where I blog about food Austin family being Latina photography Social Media technology etc. The sky is the definitely not the limit I donâ€TMt like encasing myself in just one category. Letâ€TMs talk about Klout which measures Social influence among users.Â Do you love it Follow it. I forgot to add my Klout Page I think right now the only thing me is the whole Klout thing. I love Klout but then sometimes I dislike it. The only time I truly dislike it is when my score goes down. As to whether itâ€TMs truly accurate in being a tool to measure oneâ€TMs influence Iâ€TMm on the fence. Itâ€TMs become my own personal battle very much like a Catholic trying to decide if there is a God or not. Weird but true. I highly believe Klout will improve in more ways than one when it comes to measuring oneâ€TMs influence. With the recent change some peopleâ€TMs scores either went drastically down or up) I was convinced that they are still learning and with that learning comes more improvement. But with that improvement comes more proof that I may not be as influential as I thought Iâ€TMd be. BUT At the same time I feel like I have something to work towards. Itâ€TMs like some sort of weird goal. Congratulations on your Statesman Social Media Award Nomination Thanks to my dear friend Iâ€TMve been nominated for a Statesman Social Media Award. If you could take a minute five to vote for y Gatos\,â€TM I will be forever thankful and most appreciative. Good luck to all the nominees Vote HERE. Lately youâ€TMve been blogging about your journey towards health and fitness. Iâ€TMve personally been inspired by your efforts and steady success. I feel really strongly about promoting health in Austin and in the Hispanic community. The natural place to start is with me Two places I blog about healthy living are Tacos y Gatos and FitVision. Iâ€TMm super stoked with myself. Three weeks ago I was barely able to do 20 minutes at a resistance level of 10 on the elliptical. Just this morning I did a whole hour miles!. Itâ€TMs amazing what our bodies can do if we just push Googleâ€TMs recent change in the way they do search has caused ripples in the Social Media world. What are your thoughts. Donâ€TMt get me started on Google Actually Iâ€TMm starting to appreciate the new search. Itâ€TMs interesting to see what my friends and acquaintances have to say about certain things I Google. In all honesty I donâ€TMt think itâ€TMs changed much. Google is like many other tech companies evolving. Itâ€TMs seeking to accommodate the needs of others. Some will like it some wonâ€TMt. Those that donâ€TMt will later come to appreciate it. Everyone threw a fit about Facebookâ€TMs Timeline. Now whoâ€TMs complaining Itâ€TMs a free service. Changes will happen. If anything we all benefit from changes. We learn to adapt. We learn to grow along with these companies. Itâ€TMs a little thing known the Tech Life.

This 72′ diameter round table cover is designed to be used on an outdoor table without chairsand does not havea hole foran umbrella. If you needother patio table covers that have a hole in the middle please see our Patio Table Cover overview page or navigate to our other sizes and styles by using the selection tool above. We also have table only covers that are oval and rectangular in shape so you should be able to find a patio table cover that fits your outdoor table!This outside table cover is round but it will cover both square and round tables. It should cover round tables up to 72′ in diameter and square tables up to 50′′x 50′. If you need a smaller round patio table cover see our 54′ bistro table cover. It is made of durable yet lightweight 300 denier polyester so it is easy to put on and take off. There are no straps or ties that need to be fastened. Instead our outside table covers use an elastic bottom with a built-in draw-cord to keep the cover snug and secure. Built-in mesh vents provide for needed air circulation around the cover to help stop mold and mildew from taking place.As with all of our patio furniture covers from our Elite collection this round patio table cover is constructed using double stitching on all the seams. We even pay attention to the details on the underside of the patio table cover by surge stitching all the raw edges of the fabric to make sure that there will be no loose threads or unraveling over time.

However kiln drying allows for sustainable plantation-grown teak to perform nearly on par with old-growth teak. Similar to the old-growth teak plantation-grown teak has a rich golden color throughout its grain and provides an elegant look for any outdoor wood products. It also has a lot of natural oils that make it water repellent insect resistant and suitable for use in exposed locations.

Pearson This review is from Vintage T-Shirts MORE THAN 500 AUTHENTIC TEES FROM THE AND I bought this book sight unseen off Amazon and was immediately disappointed as soon as I opened the cover. I was hoping for a collection of cool designs that would inspire me for my graphic design work. Maybe one third of the designs are quality best the rest are very mediocre. One page has six variations of the same Mickey Mouse T-shirt with different text. WTF There is a T-shirt with the original M TV logo one with a Pepsi logo you get the idea. The book is more of a historical catalog than anything else. The book also has several interviews with losers who collect T’s and have hundreds of them and who provided the shirts featured in the book. Who cares not me.

All my life I’ve wanted nothing more than to be Gay. But sadly I was born straight. Why was life so cruel I often wondered as I cried myself to sleep. Then I saw this gay wig and thought why not I put on this wig and suddenly all I can think is gay gay gay. I’m wearing rainbow flags and I’ve learned all the words to Cabaret in a week.

This review is from Lonely Planet Bermuda a Travel Survival Kit I spent two weeks in Bermuda and was very glad I brought this book along with me. I doubt very much that there are many interesting corners of the country that have been overlooked by the authors of this guide some of which I never would have thought to investigate had this book not alerted me to their existence. I especially appreciated all the historical and cultural details and found that it was an invaluable tool in keeping costs down in a country where just about everything is VERY pricey. This book has since been re-used by other members of my family on their own trips to Bermuda and has paid for itself several times over.

September 22 2002. ByÂ Maurizio Giuliano Bosnia-Herzegovina This review is from Lonely Planet Bermuda The major obstacle which hinders the performance of Lonely Planet and other guidebooks is that they often try and cover a very wide country or region such as Planet China or Planet USA” not to mention things like Planet Africa on a shoestring. This often means that in over 800 pages of a bulky book only few are really relevant to what the reader is looking for. Indeed the reader can be lost among lots of information data etc. which she or he has no interest in if I find myself in Nairobi and am looking for a restaurant do I really need to find myself browsing information about the visa procedures for Cameroon or the hotels of Sierra Leone Luckily Bermuda is a much smaller place and this has enabled the author and editors to truly produce a well-focused condensed and overall excellent guidebook. The information for the visitor is complete and accurate up-to-date and indeed extremely useful in a place which does not present particular cultural or social obstacles for the average visitor) while Bermuda may still be possible to get to know on one’s own the aid of this little guidebook will be paramount. Its sections on hotels restaurants entertainment are excellent. Coverage of things to see and do sports and other activities is down-to-the-point and very full. The sections on history and culture are also of great value excellently written easy-to-read in a captivating and pleasant prose making this truly enjoyable and worthy reading for everyone. It is indeed a book one should surely pack before setting off to Bermuda.

ByÂ DC World Traveler DC Amazon Verified Purchase(What’s this?. This review is from Lonely Planet Bermuda Guide I’m a fan of Lonely Planet guides as I like to get out and explore offbeat places on my own and meet the locals. Their Bermuda guide was a great planning tool to do so. Coupled with Insight’s laminated map it was all I needed for my 9-day trip. The Guide is set up by Bermuda’s parishes which is a bit cumbersome until you get a grasp of the island’s geography. Even when you do it’s a bit difficult to figure out if the place you saw on the road by bus is in Warwick or Southampton or Somerset Parish. So the really map helped orient me before I hit the tarmac. As my work keeps me indoors when at home I like to spend as much time as possible physically engaged in the outdoors when I’m on vacation. The only portion of the guide which should be changed is the part about biking the Old Railway Trail. This ranges from grass with a tire rut to dirt and rocks through the woods to becoming synonymous with the main roads of the island depending on whether it’s been taken over by development. Very little of the trail is paved off of the main road and there are places with steep grades with steps. Also about every quarter to half mile on the real there are metal barriers over which you have to lift your bike making a continuous pedal cumbersome. The scenery is great on many portions of Warwick and Somerset in particular but I wouldn’t plan on a cycling vacation for exercise or for primary transportation. Cycling the roads is precarious as they are barely wide enough for two cars and I never saw a straight segment of street on the island. Shrubbery juts out from stone walls at bike level in yards all over the island making the situation even more difficult. I did about 40 miles of trail and road and although I’m happy I did it I wouldn’t recommend it for the faint of heart. Scooters look pretty dangerous and accidents and fatalities are rampant even amongst locals. I took a ride my last evening on the back of one and the curvy roads are precarious even when seated behind an experienced local. I’m a big risk taker but I respect limits of common sense. No rental cars are available on the island but the bus and ferry service is good. So get a multiple day buss/ferry pass and enjoy the public transportation after perhaps one full day on a pedal bike. Rentals are steep at $25 a day published but I got the shop to reduce it to $15 with some quibbling. My Huffy 18 speed mountain bike was sufficient and you do need those speeds on the steep hills!. Do a lot of online research on the Bermuda sites listed in the Guide when planning your trip and email or phone ahead of time as Bermudians tend to change printed schedules on a whim. guide should emphasize that cab fares are very very expensive with a minimum fare of about $5 for a very short ride to $20 or more to traverse from one hotel to another for dinner. Cabbies are independent and subscribe to a call service. other part the guide left out is that single women are pursued by Bermudans to no end. The first question I always seemed to get is is your husband?. to confirm I was fresh meat on the island. It seems that American women traveling alone are curious commodities and perhaps seen as by local men. other part the guide leaves out is that the tourist industry is heavily supported by guest workers from Europe Asia and Latin America making communication sometimes problematic. All in all a great source to give you planning tools costs and the inside scoop on the island.. Help other customers find the most helpful reviewsÂ Was this review helpful to you?Â Comment.

An Good Starting Point Lacks a Little Depth. February 4 2009. ByÂ Bryan Newman Paul MN This review is from Frommer’s Florida with Your Family From Theme Park Fun to Sunny Beach Getaways With Your Family Series This is a decent little book but since it covers the entire state it\needs to stick to the main attractions and does not got too deep into\any location. There will be just a couple of recommendations for\restaurants for example and attractions like Gatorland are missing from\the Orlando coverage. Quality This book seems a little more glossy than the run of the mill\Frommer’s book and it did an excellent job when I was flipping through\and showing my seven year old possible things we could do while on our\vacation. It is not crammed with photos but it has enough to make page\flipping worthwhile. Coverage Since my son is into nature and fossil collection we needed a\lot more resources to find a fossil expedition and specific nature\stops. Also since our trip was mainly concentrating on the southwest\coast the other 3/4ths of the book did not help much. And as stated\above there were not a whole lot of different options this is a pretty\general book possibly because the targeted audience are British\vacationers focusing on Disney and Universal theme parks. The travel\information was decent although quaintly British again. British thing Forgive me if I am missing something about Frommers but\this book is strongly aimed at the British visitor to Florida. For the\most part this is no problem as long as you can get over hire car\instead of rental car or the idea of baby food\, But there is\a decidedly British tilt to attraction selection as well for example\biplane rides for kids with Biggles fascination. Very few kids on this\side of the pond have any idea what Biggles is about. The book does not\say it is written for Brits but it seems to have been. tells you\where you can get British newspapers. It still worked for us as a very\high level overview of Florida but to match our families interests we\had to go other places as well. Overall impression Decent book but light on specifics or depth of\choices. If you are looking for off the beaten track options you might\want.

ByÂ Volkert Volkersz WA United States This review is from Going Places Family Getaways in the Pacific Northwest This guide for traveling in the Pacific Northwest with kids covers Oregon Washington and British Columbia. Each state/province is subdivided into metropolitan areas and geographical regions. Then each area or town has listings for places to stay places to eat and things to see and do. While this volume is exhaustive in terms of EVERYTHING you could see or do it certainly covers the highlights of things you would enjoy seeing and doing with your children. We recently planned a trip to Oregon with a teenager using this guide as one of many resources. We were not disappointed and as a matter of fact we weren’t able to cover everything suggested in this book in the time we had available. I would suggest that these guides for going places with children work just as well for adults who want to glean the highlights of locations they’ll be visiting in the Pacific Northwest. Since we were traveling with a tent trailer we did not make use of the to stay feature however in glancing through them some seem to be a bit on the pricey side. Also we discovered a great hamburger restaurant in Bend Oregon Butte” that was not listed in this guide. So like I said Places is not exhaustive but it certainly is helpful.

ByÂ Tina Beth OR This review is from Going Places Family Getaways in the Pacific Northwest This is a great reference book for places to visit in the Pacific Northwest HOWEVER be sure to call the places you intend to visit before you go. A lot of the information is now outdated and the prices are not even remotely accurate that they have published from 2000. We took a trip to Portland to visit Farrel’s Ice Cream to find it has been out of business for year. We called Yamhill’s Flying M Ranch about their cabins to hear must be a really old ad\,we don’t have cabins. A trip this weekend to Astoria Oregon we found the locations they list as are no longer free. Help other customers find the most helpful reviewsÂ Was this review helpful to you?Â Comment.

California Personal Injury Lawyer Get you compensation you deserve. Tragically personal injury can occur to anyone at any place without any pre-indication. If you have been involved in an accident that was occurred due to the negligence or recklessness of other person you may be eligible to recover compensation. For car accident cases you will usually be better off with a California car accident attorney. But there are different factors that can contribute to the success of your case.Â As a victim it is essential for you to find the right California personal injury lawyer. There are various points you should consider while hiring a personal injury attorney.Â The most essential points are the skill quality and reputation of the California accident attorney you hire to handle your case. The foremost thing you should do before choosing a California personal injury lawyer is to ensure that the attorney’s expertise and knowledge are satisfactory to effectively protect your rights.Â You can also ask about his success rate and make inquiries from the State Bar of California about any past disciplinary actions against him. Next you must personally fix an appointment with the attorney so that you can know more about his background and experience.Â By doing this you can make sure whether he is able to understand your case or not. After knowing the experience and area of expertise of California accident lawyer you must then make an inquiry about the consultation fees. There are many personal injury attorneys that offer a free consultation but there are some who do not. It is better to confirm the cost of services. Generally lawyers are paid at the end of the case by receiving a certain percentage of the winnings.Â Make sure that this percentage or other amount they will charge is discussed and completely spelled out in any agreement you sign with the personal injury attorney. Based on pertinent documents and other evidence at your disposal your personal injury will attempt to prove your case. The grounds for a personal injury lawsuit will vary from case to case but generally most personal injury lawyers try to prove that the defendant was negligent in such a way that harmed the plaintiff. Depending on a plaintiff’s injuries a plaintiff may recover general damages and special damages. General damages will include an award for pain and suffering while special damages compensate the plaintiff for medical expenses and lost earnings. But remember every type of claim has a deadline for filing the claim in court and this differ from state to state. The time period within which you can bring a lawsuit for personal injury is known as the Statute of Limitations. After the expiration of this time period the claim usually will be vanishedâ€”despite of its merits. There are different exceptions to the deadlines like minority incompetency etc. thus it may still be worth evaluating a claim even after the deadline has expired. Thus after your unfortunate accident you must act promptly on any claims which you believe you may desire to pursue. Read more.. Home. The legal process can be a maze of confusion and fear for anyone that is not accustomed to navigating through it. When someone is involved in a personal injury accident they suddenly find themselves in need pf a crash course in the judicial process. It can be scary and frustrating. Finding the right personal injury lawyer locating a doctor that is willing to work with you regarding his charges and worrying about losing your job if you have to miss work are just a few of the concerns that generally go along with being the victim in a personal injury accident. Once you have resolved the most immediate concerns the often lengthy process of determining who was negligent fault and then what your claim is worth begins. Lawyer use a number of tactics to try and determine who was at fault and then what the victimâ€TMs claim is worth. One common legal process used by attorneys in a personal injury accident case is to take the deposition of the victim. A deposition is a way for the lawyers to take the testimony of a witness prior to an actual trial. It is more formal than an office interview but less formal than a trial. The testimony that you give at a deposition is taken under oath and can be introduced at trial in most cases. In some cases a witnesses deposition testimony can even be introduced at trial if the witness later becomes unavailable. The idea of a deposition can be frightening for anyone that is unfamiliar with the process. If you are scheduled for a deposition or have a personal injury accident case that could require a deposition consider the following tips when preparing for the deposition. 1. Be informed. Your personal injury attorney should help inform you about the procedures involved in a deposition who will be there where it will be held how long it should take etc. As a rule the defendant plaintiff and their attorneys as well as a court reporter will be present. The length of the deposition can vary greatly depending on the issues in your case. Spend as much time as you need asking your attorney questions so that you feel well informed prior to the deposition. 2. Practice. An experienced personal injury attorney will generally spend some time with his client practicing before an actual deposition. Time spent answering questions that are likely to be asked at the deposition will make you feel much more at ease during the actual deposition. 3. Tell the truth. Remember that a deposition is taken under oath. This means that the answers you give during a deposition may be able to be used in an actual trial if you answer the same question differently at trial. If you are unsure how to answer a question or are afraid to answer a question consult with your attorney thatâ€TMs why he is there. Read more..

In 2008 a freak car accident resulted in a severe brain injury for a Wisconsin toddler. A recent personal injury settlement ensures that the little girlâ€TMs family will be able to pay her medical expenses for life. The Green Bay Press Gazette indicate that the personal injury settlement which was reached between the family and several responsible parties was worth a total of 20 million. This lofty sum is a record injury settlement in Outagamie County Wisconsin topping the previous largest settlement by several million dollars. The accident that injured the young girl only two years old at the time was relatively minor. A large truck owned by a well-drilling company ran a red light but applied its breaks well before hitting the girlsâ€TM motherâ€TMs minivan. Even though the impact of the crash was not severe a pipe rack attached to the truck came loose and several pipes crashed through the windows of the car. One of these pipes tragically struck the young girl in the head. Her familyâ€TMs personal injury lawsuit alleged that the pipe rack collapsed because of faulty design by the manufacturer. As a result of the pipeâ€TMs impact the girl suffered permanent injuries including traumatic epilepsy and blindness. According to reports of the personal injury settlement the girlâ€TMs medical expenses totaled almost 900\,000 in the two years since the accident occurred. The settlement money will be paid by multiple parties. The manufacturer of the pipe rack that failed is on the hook for roughly 300\,000. In addition the driver of the truck and the truck company are liable for about 1 million of the settlementâ€TMs total fund. The rest of the total some 18.7 million will be paid by the distributor of the pipe rack. Read more.. Home. The adjuster was stuttering when I applied the techniques taught here.

Mesothelioma is notoriously resistant to common anti cancer chemotherapy as result of some reasons. The cancer takes a long time to mature and show symptoms by the time these symptoms appear the tumor will be well formed with a lot of layers of dead cells that the anti cancer drugs will find it difficult to penetrate and also by the time a diagnosis of mesothelioma is made most victims have but a short time left to live so the drugs do not have enough time to exert their maximal effect.

I was speaking with a woman about a month ago she was looking for coverage for her final expenses. When we met she was in her front yard tending her snake hydrangeas ferns and spider plants and as we conversed she told me she transplants at least once per year because she uses fertilizer to help her plants grow. Widowed with grown children living and working away from home she owns her small home mortgage completed and a small car. Middle-aged and in good health I discovered that my new acquaintance surprisingly however is not unlike many Americans. She does not have a will. According to a FindLaw.com survey conducted June of 2008 nearly 60 percent of Americans do not have a will. Although more than half of the persons surveyed aged 50 or older had a will that percentage declined to 25 percent of persons with a will aged 25 to 34. Persons in the survey between the ages of 18 and 24 those with a will is less than ten percent. Very few of us spend our daily lives thinking about death. Even fewer think about what it is we would like to leave our children or our loved ones. In talking with people about their final expenses if they have thought about the cost of a funeral they have not thought about what happens after they have left us. A sobering but necessary thought. I have found that the younger my acquaintance is the less chance there is that the words and are in their vocabulary. So you if you say you don’t have a will my immediate question is not?. I was told by one person I don’t own anything what do I need a will for?. Well if you are a home owner or you are a business owner a will is not only prudent but necessary especially if your financial empire has residual income. Read more.. Home.

For 15 years opposite sides of a life and death struggle involving Terry Schiavo who in February of 1990 at age 26 collapsed in her apartment lapsed into a coma and only recovered to a vegetative state fought through numerous court appearances and with each other in family battles that resulted in a debate fueled by money-powered advocates from both pro-life and right-to-die camps. The debate also went to the US Congress and prompted a statement by then-President George Bush who said that because there were questions and substantial doubts about the case Terri Schiavo had no written directive as to whether she would wish to have her feeding tube removed or not. The Schiavo Family’s insistence that Terry wanted to remain alive and Terry’s husband Michael Schiavo’s wish to allow his wife to die a natural death could have been avoided with one simple documentation.

People want privacy especially people that owe money on civil judgments. More and more people are using private post office box stores such as The UPS Store because they usually have more features at a better price than the USPS post office offers.Â Some judgment debtors go to great lengths to live the grid and they try to make only their post office box show up on any public record data searches. To recover a judgment often you must personally serve the debtor to compel them and sometimes third parties to appear in court to try to discover information that may lead to the debtor’s available assets. When a debtor goes to great lengths to hide behind a PO box or a PMB one usually must hire someone to find the debtor’s other address hopefully the address that the debtor lives at.

Though legal matters do take time to fold up but the quality and tenure of supervision not only helps the client financially and in recovering with all aid possible from the government but more so it also helps set an example for all involved in the vast number of motorcar accidents that take place every year. Without the professional guidance of an experienced lawyer for motorcar accidents it does not ensure a smooth legal proceeding from which the client can be assured of total recovery and complete safety. To start with the place and venue of the accident needs to be correctly captured in detail. This needs to be done both in order to report the case with police as well as for insurance purposes. As such all evidence and events of the occurring incident need to be detailed while being captured. It is here that the invaluable expertise of the lawyer acting for motorcar accidents comes into the picture. All names and contact information of witnesses along with others involved in line with information regarding the damaged vehicles involved need to be captured. In today’s mobile age photographs collected on the spot with help of mobile phone cameras can come in very handy to the car accident lawyer later on. Moving further the entire procedure of tackling the insurance companies is a huge task and needs the experience of a professional to handle the associated formalities and ensure the claim is realized in full. For this arduous task the lawyer who is well-equipped with all insurance related developments is indispensable. On the financial front any claims that are to be derived from the contesting party is also the responsibility of the lawyer involved. Over here it is not only the sum of money to be claimed that is at stake but also the manner in which this has to be realized. A car accident lawyer for motorcar accidents who is well versed with the existing norms and prevailing trends in this line will carry out all the formalities in a smooth way consuming the least of time.

A car accident lawyer working in motorcar accidents do charge fees that raise an eyebrow and at times they can be on a percentage basis of the recovered amount in concern. However what we need to be aware of is that the client stands to gain both monetarily and in health before the money actually goes into the pockets of the lawyer. With indefinite limits of insurance amounts on question a resourceful lawyer can go quite a distance in helping the client recover the claim amount in full. In fact there have been instances where multiple sources of claim and settlement have arisen which in turn turnout as windfall sources of income. However they are made to happen only with the keen eye of a car accident lawyer for detail of the costly services of the legal aid. The claim in return not only affects the party on suit but also to all the indirectly related distant relations like the collective owners of the accident met vehicle all government authorities manufacturing company of the automobile and lastly the involved employers.

Jules Tygiel offers a rare semi-unbiased look into Ronald Reagan’s life before during and after his presidency. Tygiel confronts the reader with the perception of Reagan as a person with no depth or unique ideas of his own and gives us all the tools in Reagan’s life that molded such a personality. Tygiel offers detailed analysis of Reagan’s life and gives the reader a chance to explain for themselves Reagan’s abrupt change in political beliefs and liberal ideals. While at times utterly confusing it is also not difficult to understand Reagan’s stance of the moment when you remember his desire to please and be seen in the most admirable light by others. While reviewing Reagan’s life one cannot help but be either incensed or envious of his uncanny ability to escape reality and deliver fantasy to an eager people. Tygiel states that Reagan’s abrupt political changes seem to have no rhyme or reason to support them. However Tygiel also implies that Reagan’s political changes were initially deceptive and later opportunistic. Reagan’s father Jack Reagan is portrayed as an Irish Catholic alcoholic which Ronald Reagan referred to as his father’s Tygiel displays Jack Reagan as a hard-working semi-ambitious man who had a problem with alcohol. Jack Reagan’s personal beliefs were strongly aligned with the Democratic Party. Tygiel mentions Jack Reagan’s refusal to patronage shops with known anti-Semitic views. Jack Reagan was willing to inconvenience himself in order to make a political statement. In contrast while Ronald Reagan stated to have his father’s same democratic beliefs he was not as willing to inconvenience himself to make a political statement. Tygiel gives the example of the African-American players on Ronald Reagan’s school football team being denied lodging in a hotel. The coach was furious and insisted that the entire team sleep on the bus and make a political stand by doing such. Ronald Reagan instead offered the African-American players a room in his home to avoid such a controversial issue. This causes one to question Ronald’s true political beliefs. Tygiel also questions the true democratic beliefs of Ronald when Jack Reagan dies. While demonstrating the sense of betrayal felt by Jack Reagan when his son Neil starts speaking about his republican beliefs Tygiel shows how deep Jack Reagan’s political beliefs travel. Tygiel states that Ronald felt a sense of relief when his father passed away because he no longer had to fear disappointing him with his political views. Read more..

Coping with the aftermath of a serious injury isn’t just a matter of physical recovery. For the victims of life-changing injuries such as spinal injury there often needs to be a psychological adjustment too as they come to terms with the change in circumstances and the trauma of the event itself. Why me. Once the physical recovery has started victims of spinal injuries can often fall into a cycle of depression particularly if the injury means a complete alteration of their lifestyle. For victims who may have been very physically active before their accident the knowledge that they are now restricted in what they can do and achieve has very real implications to their psychological wellbeing. In this context the question me?. is often asked. Unfortunately there is no reply to that question that will give the victim any comfort. But what families and friends can do is to help the victim focus on a new question next?. Giving the victim time to adjust. Time is supposed to be a great healer. One thing that spinal injury victims need is the time to adjust to their new life after a serious accident. Because of the nature of spinal injuries victims may need longer than most to come to terms with the fundamental changes that a life restricted by the long-term effects of a spinal injury can bring. During that period the most important thing a victim will need is support from those around them including their family friends and even their solicitor. They have to be gently reassured that their life over just because they can no longer do the things they used to do. As they come to accept their situation a new optimism and drive can emerge pushing them forward to achieve far more than they thought was possible. But it’s during the darker days that positive reassurance is needed to convince a spinal injury victim that there is light at the end of the tunnel. How a solicitor can help. Often it’s the practical things that can make a difference to someone coming to terms with a spinal injury. Mobility in particular is vitally important the victim needs to feel that they are not completely reliant on others and regaining some level of independence can be crucial to recovery. If your solicitor has managed to secure an interim payment for example they may then be able to put the victim in touch with a car company that can supply the victim with a specially adapted vehicle. Something as simple as going to the shops or being able to move around their own home without help can mean a great deal to a previously able-bodied victim of a spinal injury. Read more.. Home. If you’ve had an accident that wasn’t your fault then once the medical concerns have been taken care of it is often a matter of talking to an injury claims solicitor to find out if you are entitled to compensation. However in more serious cases such as brain injury it’s not just the financial concerns that take precedence. A serious brain injury is a life-changing event. Unlike a relatively minor injury like whiplash a brain injury can mean a lifetime of care and a complete change in how you and your family live their lives. So in cases like this how much help can your legal team provide. Not just financial support. An ordinary solicitor may be able to represent your interests in a court but serious injury specialists have a far broader spectrum of support to offer. Because serious injury cases such as brain injury compensation claims are often more complex in nature serious injury specialists take on fewer cases than ordinary solicitors. This means that they get to know each individual case in far greater depth often forming a close personal friendship with the victim and family themselves. This does not colour their judgement of the legal process but instead enables them to better understand the individual circumstances of their clients and their specific needs. Specialist serious injury solicitors can also help in more practical ways too. Due to the nature of their business they can call on the expert help of a wide range of medical specialists who can provide both expert testimony during the compensation claim process and also specialist medical treatment for the victim. In head injury cases the experience of a neurologist familiar with trauma injuries for example can make a huge difference to the long term treatment path that’s taken. It can also enable the victim to access special therapies that they may not have been able to if they had remained with the usual primary care providers. Getting things moving quickly. Read more..

One of these opportunities is to make a claim for compensation providing the injury was suffered as a result of someone else’s negligence. When making the claim it would probably be advised because of the nature of the injury to call on the services of a specialist solicitor. A brain injury claim can be quite complex in their nature and it is better to be represented by someone who is an expert in the field rather than a complete novice.The first question that should be asked determines exactly that have they undertaken any previous brain injury work and how many cases they are currently handling. As mentioned previously a solicitor with a lower number of current cases could be better for those with a more complex case. If the solicitor hasn’t undertaken any cases in the field of brain injuries then it probably isn’t worth considering. In their line of business they take on far fewer cases than that of a standard solicitor. This allows for the solicitor to familiarise themselves with each case and allows for the solicitor to understand the needs of the client.When looking for a solicitor to represent a case for a claim it is important to consider whether the solicitor is accredited by Headway the brain injury association. If they are the chances are they will have a high level of knowledge when it comes to brain injuries. Like belonging in Law Society’s Personal Injury Panel or the Association of Personal injury lawyers having these kind of credential can give a good indication of the kind of specialist interest that a solicitor has.There must be some kind of comfortable knowledge of how a case for a brain injury claim would be funded beforehand which can be done simply by reading up on the subject. A good confident level will probably help determine what type of legal aid is needed. Read more.. Home.

Canadians who have completed their sentences after having been convicted of a criminal offense can apply for a pardon provided they have demonstrated they have been law-abiding citizens ever since. In special circumstances the Governor General can also grant clemency if there is new evidence of innocence or other reason to remove records or sentences. It’s normal to hear declarations of protest from anyone who has been convicted of a crime. The old joke is that the prisons are full of innocent people. Unfortunately there have been many wrongful convictions over the years due to bad evidence or over-zealous police looking for somebody to arrest. Before the advent of DNA evidence there was no sure-fire way to eliminate suspects based on unimpeachable scientific analysis of hair bodily fluids and skin cells. Many innocent people were executed over the years and it was considered simply the sad cost of doing business in the justice system. This article discusses some of the high-profile Canadian cases and offers insight into some of the safeguards to exonerate those who have been wrongly convicted. Perhaps the most shocking trial was that of Steven Truscott in 1959. He was tried as an adult convicted and sentenced to hang at the age of 14 for the rape-murder of 12-year old classmate Lynne Harper. His death sentence was commuted to life imprisonment after four months on death row facing the gallows and he was paroled in 1969 after considerable public outcry over the circumstantial case. His conviction was later deemed a miscarriage of justice and he received $6.5 million in compensation in 2008. Donald Marshall Jr. of Sydney Nova Scotia was 17 years old he received a life sentence for the murder of his friend Sandy Seale. He was released after 10 years when someone else confessed to the crime. Fortunately for many wrongfully convicted murder suspects the death sentence has not existed in Canada for many years. One can only imagine how many innocent people were hanged in those days before the truth could come out using modern forensic evidence. David Milgaard Guy Paul Morin William Mullins-Johnson James Driskell and Thomas Sophonow were other convicted murderers proven later to be innocent and given millions in government compensation to make up for decades spent behind bars. Some were acquitted upon appeal and others were granted special clemency by the Governor General representing the Canadian Cabinet. Regular Canadian pardons are granted after a waiting period and a successful application by a person who has served all the conditions of a conviction such as a jail sentence fine and probation. The waiting period for indictable offences is currently five years and may be increased to ten years if and when Bill C-23 is passed. Read more.. Home. 506 queries in 0.490 seconds.

If you feel that you or someone you love has experienced a negative side effect that resulted from the use of Yasmin or Yaz birth control it is important to speak with your doctor and then consult with aÂ pharmaceutical malpractice attorney.

The ad campaign claimed the medication could help alleviate such things as acne mood swings and other conditions associated with menstruation. The ads also claimed that there were minimal side effects. The FDA found this to be misleading advertising and that they overstated the effectiveness of the birth control pill. It is reported that Bayer paid around $20 million dollars to correct the misrepresentations. The FDA claimed that Bayer had overstated the benefits of Yaz and downplayed its risks. More recent bad news for Bayer is that according to a recent study in the British Medical Journal Yaz is three times more likely to cause fatal blood clots than older contraceptives. Ask aÂ pharmaceutical malpractice attorney for advice on how to properly pursue a course of action if you have experienced any of these negative side effects as a result of using Yasmin andÂ Yaz birth control. In the rare event that a patient taking the birth pill control suffers complications that lead to death the family can pursue a wrongful death or malpractice suit against those responsible.

The medical field is where most malpractice claims occur including suits brought against pharmaceutical giants. In summary\,Â YasminÂ andÂ Yaz birth controlÂ have been the subject of multiple federal lawsuits against the Bayer Corporation and the suits allege that the company failed to warn women and their medical providers of the increased risk of injury associated with the pills.

Compensation can be in the form of repayment of medical costs that have been incurred the cost of rehabilitation services and loss of income both past and future.

It is best if these burns have occurred though the fault of someone else or which could have been prevented if correct safety procedures had been introduced to consult a personal injury lawyer who specialises in injuries as a result of negligence or burn injuries in general. Personal injury lawyers expect you to provide evidence of the injury such as medical reports and x rays and pictures of the burn as well as proof the other party was responsible. The injury lawyer will try their best to get your claim to court and win compensation for you especially if it has affected your life. They will make sure the company or person responsible was wrong under law and that caused your personal injury. Burn cases tend to be win no fee. So if you win the personal injury claim you will receive compensation for injuries suffered future treatment you may need in the future loss of earnings or loss of job medical bills as well as emotional trauma and family care. All this depends on the severity of the burn injury. Employers are obliged by law to ensure safe working conditions and it is this key factor your personal injury lawyer can emphasise to win the case. Also common is what is known as an burn. These are through airways and lungs and symptoms include sore throat burnt tongues as a result of eating hot foods wheezing inhaling soot or fumes. Again you can file a personal injury claim if these are the result of negligence. The company you work for may have an environment where you are inhaling fumes or your skin may burn if exposed to radiation. You can claim for a personal injury when you have suffered a burn but only if it is the fault of someone else. If you were not alerted of workplace hazards subjected to an environment that caused skin injuries had toxic chemicals spilt on you or been in a workplace fire that was caused by the company then you can lodge a claim. The best way to progress forward from here would be hiring a personal injury lawyer who will try to make sure you get 100 of the compensation and any extra add-ons. This is why it is important to establish whether or not you can make a claim because if it was your own fault or an unpreventable accident it will be more difficult to make a personal injury claim for a burn injury.

Over 25\,000 people are injured every year on Britain’s roads. The pedestrian crossing is the most common place for injury on the roads. There are more accidents when a car is doing a speed of 30mph or less but this leads to less serious injuries but more claims for personal injury compensation. Indeed children are more likely to be involved in pedestrian accidents as they are less likely to know much about traffic and run into roads. The driver should be aware of pedestrians walking on pavements and standing at pedestrian crossings especially during traffic light changes. If you are a pedestrian and can sufficiently prove that you were not responsible for the injury then you have a good case for claiming compensation. You need to establish the scale of your injuries first and determine that your injuries were not the result of you walking in front of a car. Make sure you were not walking in the road as any hopes of getting compensation would be dashed if the driver can prove this. When this has been established you should visit a Doctor even as a precautionary measure. You will need to record all your visits to the Doctor and anything else that relates to the accident. The more proof of the scale of the injury this shows the more compensation you will receive. Therefore it is best to file a claim as quickly as possible and you will need to contact a personal injury lawyer who specialises in this area. Personal injury lawyers can greatly strengthen your case for compensation. The Personal injury lawyer will develop a case with strong arguments which is why it is important to have documents such as Hospital visits and medical bills. The personal injury claim will then be established and the personal injury lawyer may bring in eyewitnesses which can greatly enhance your case. The personal injury lawyer therefore is integral if you feel you are entitled to compensation for an accident as a pedestrian that was not your fault. Pedestrian injuries are more common in busy areas and at busy crossings. Accidents are inevitable as there is always going to be one bad driver who misjudges the situation and ends up knocking down a pedestrian.There is nothing more frustrating for the Motorist than a pedestrian slowing down their journey so it is important to establish if you have suffered a pedestrian injury that you were in no way the cause of your own accident. If you were crossing the road when the light turned green you may find it harder to gain compensation. Nonetheless if you know it was not your fault then hiring a personal injury lawyer should reassure you that all is being done to get you the compensation that you feel you deserve.

Clients need not be worried that such professionals will run into serious road bumps related to obscure technicalities. Work injuries are a big part of the practice. This is particularly true if a company was following a policy that was not safe and put an individual at risk. If that individual then gets hurt he/she probably has the right to sue. This is why most companies put such a high emphasis on being safe. Without this they can potentially face law suits. Products that don’t work right and end up causing harm might also allow one to turn to the legal system for recourse. Toys that have been constructed with toxic material for example can cause harm to young children. If the company was aware of this but did not make an effort to change its practices then it can be sued often quite severely for monetary compensation. Even the field of medicine spawns suits against practitioners that do not know what they are doing or that make mistakes. Surgeries that are performed incorrectly or medication that is given in the wrong dosage can certainly causes injury sometimes permanent.

Texting while driving has become a huge problem for law enforcement in the past couple years. Texting while driving makes a driver 23 times more likely to crash compared to focused driving. Not only are the chances for collision higher but the odds of serious injury are increased as well. Texting and driving has become a widespread issue with the total number of text messages sent last year totaling over 22 times higher than just four years ago. With such heightened risk it’s no surprise that law enforcement has been looking to crack down on texting and driving. It is estimated by the FMSCA that every time a driver types a text message they take their eyes off the road for 4.6 out of every 6 seconds. If the driver were going 55 mph that seemingly quick 4.6 seconds would actually be a football field in distance traveled without once looking at the road. In March U.S. Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood announced a new federal rule to ban texting while driving specific to truck drivers and commercial bus drivers carrying more than 8 passengers. want the drivers of big rigs and buses and those who share the roads with them to be safe\, said Secretary LaHood. is an important safety step and we will be taking more to eliminate the threat of distracted driving. The consequence of texting and driving for these truck and bus drivers will be a civil or criminal penalty of up to $2\,750. While many groups are showing great support of the new ruling quite a few groups such as the American Association for Justice feel the rule does not go far enough. The final ruling only prohibits personal phones and communication devices and many groups feel that on-board computers and communications equipment can also be very distracting. This might be a more difficult battle to win since many operators need to be contacted in cases of emergency and many trucking Associations will want to have their say. Both the American Bus Association as well as the American Trucking Association have shown support for the texting while driving law. If nothing else this new ruling will help set a precedent for the low tolerance of texting while driving and many feel that an extension to all drivers may be coming soon. Texting and driving has driven up the risk for collision and serious personal injury therefore banning texting and driving altogether would have little to no consequence.

Writing or reading a text message behind theÂ wheel can drastically slow down a driver’s reaction time according to a study released Wednesday by the Texas Transportation Institute. while driving basically doubles a driver’s reaction time and makes the driver less able to respond to sudden roadway dangers if a vehicle were to make a sudden stop in front of them or if a child was to run across the road\, said researcher Christine Yager who managed the study. Reaction times slowed from one to two seconds with no texting to three to four seconds while texting the study found. The study also found very little difference in response times between a driver composing a message and a driver reading one. you’re on a freeway where the speed limit is 60 in rush hour and a vehicle suddenly stops in front of you that’s not enough time to react if your eyes are glanced down at your phone\, Yager said. Researchers studied 42 drivers between the ages of 16 and 54 on a test-track driving course. Researchers said the study is the first published work in the U.S. to examine texting while driving in actual vehicles rather than in simulators which have been used more frequently in previous studies for safety concerns.

Approaching injury lawyers can help with more than just gaining compensation. Through professional expertise the legal representatives can offer a wide range of services between the basic legal advice and the final settlement. Gathering the key evidence and developing first-rate legal documents to present the client’s case in the best light possible are only the main services available when using expert injury lawyers. It all begins with presenting the legal options. The injured party may not be aware of the wide choice of possibilities available to him after the ensued incident. Sometimes the opportunities are limited or hidden by the insurers of the responsible party to prevent any loss which might be forced on their client. The service provided by the personal injury lawyer is a thorough analysis of all possibilities followed by a consultancy to help the client decide which approach would be best. Personal injury lawyers generally operate based on a win no fee policy. As a result the client’s best interest is a priority. The second phase of building a case is gathering all essential evidence. Personal injury lawyers assist with locating witnesses and acquiring valuable information through testimonies obtaining access to accident sites and performing a thorough examination of the incident. Some representatives also work in attaining photographic and documented proof of both physical and psychological damage cause to the victim and his possessions. All these findings are included in reports which certify the impact of the incident. The next stage involves representative services. This facility is highly beneficial if the client suffered severe injuries and cannot be present at all legal settlements with the responsible party. The lawyer represents the client’s needs and desires completely even if the case is due to go to court. The basic settlements are another service from which clients can benefit as most people involved in an accident prefer to settle their businesses outside court to avoid a public scandal and additional expenses. This type of settlement is highly encouraged by lawyers representing both parties to save clients more time and money. The compensation fee and other services are decided by the injured client and the realistic approach is decided by the final advice provided by the lawyer. The final proceedings can be handled by the legal representative who negotiates the settlement fee as close to the client’s goal as possible. An accident can be a traumatizing experience for the people involved and their families which is why all the technicalities need to be performed by qualified individuals to ensure that both parties receive what they deserve. Accident victims need to be aware of two important aspects when handling the consequences of the incident first of all no person should give elaborate information about what happened without getting initial advice from a legal representative. Only the basic and strictly necessary information should be provided when being questioned by the authorities. Secondly one should never try to tackle the situation with the other party alone as the victim can endanger his chances of having a strong case. By taking account of the two necessities the personal injury lawyer can begin to solve the case straightaway. Read more.. Home. People who have experienced accidents in their lifetime are instantly subsidised by the law. The system provides distinct privileges to injured parties and ensures that all those involved in an accident receive the fair quality of treatment they deserve. However these privileges can be missed out on by underestimating the value of the case in hand or by delaying the initiation of an injury claim. Consequences of these actions can result in lost evidence vague witness testimonies and the limited amount of time in which legal action can be pursued can expire. To maximize the value of the rights as an injured party one must choose the appropriate legal representative. By approaching the right injury lawyer the risk of losing certain opportunities can be reduced. In order to make the right choice an individual must take account of criterions such as reputation experience and the package provided. In the end the correct decision can be rewarded with a substantial benefit included of both financial and servicing compensations. The first factor to look for when choosing the right personal injury lawyer is the experience. Whether it involves a website a recommendation from a close friend or a newspaper ad a person should always try to find out as much as possible about his potential legal representative. This involves looking at the professional’s background. The years of practice are not as important as the rate of cases won and the rate of cases lost. References are also very helpful when choosing to form a partnership. Considering that an injury case is a highly important legal aspect providing that information should not be a problem if the recommendations are not available on-site. Depending on the severity of the case one might consider hiring a lawyer specialized in the type of accident incurred. If the accident does not constitute a complicated event or any great damages an injury lawyer with a general expertise will be adequate. From a client’s perspective it is highly important to know that all the available opportunities are being further explored to ensure the success of one’s case. At the outset a good injury lawyer will always make sure that the injured client will get medical examination and treatment to prevent the condition from getting any worse. If the client cannot find a doctor he will be provided with one immediately. The personal injury lawyer should be able to instruct his client effectively to not sign anything or give any statements without his consent to not accept any offers or visit the doctors recommended by the adjuster. A respectable personal injury lawyer works by a win no fee policy and ensures 100 client compensation which are proof that the lawyer will look after the client’s best interest and support the legal procedures successfully. The first interaction a client has with his potential legal representative is by phone call. It is highly important that the injury lawyer inspires confidence and enables the individual to communicate freely with him. This is a highly important criterion when choosing the ideal legal representative as the client needs the reassurance that his lawyer will fight for his rights effectively. Read more.. Home. To most filing an accident claim of any kind can be a great hassle and burden. But if you are the victim of someone else’s negligence by way of injury or damage to your property it is essential that you take the opportunity to claim whatever you are entitled to. Follow these handy hints and tips to ensure you are not left in the dark when it comes to making a claim and that you walk away with the best possible outcome. Don’t panic. At the scene of any accident especially a car accident it is very easy to panic in the knowledge that you are partly responsible for holding up traffic 2 miles behind. Worse still if people yourself have sustained injuries your initial reaction will be to panic get agitated and play the blame game. Avoid over analysing things at this stage. Using a road accident as an example all you can do at this stage is exchange contact details with the other party to further arrange a settlement with the relevant insurance company. If the accident has occurred at work or in the home due to a faulty product or piece of equipment the company should proceed to look immediately into how and why the incident happened. Following an accident or injury within the home at the hands of a faulty product a complaint should be made as soon as possible with the relevant manufacturer. Be thorough Before filing an accident claim you should have sufficient evidence to back it up. Supplying a solicitor with the basic outline will do you no favours in the long run so be prepared with all the necessary information. Be sure to adequately research your accident location taking photos at the scene of the accident gathering eye witnesses etc. It is also vital that you record time off work to conduct the research. Think ahead Read more.. Home. As an employee many questions about specific rules and rights that come with it can be raised throughout employment. This is rightly so as you should be informed of the rights and limitations that an employer has regarding your work. From hiring to firing and everything in between specific topics should be discussed regarding the rules. These specific laws vary from state to state so if you have serious concerns or questions consider contacting a local law firm to help you review your rights as an employee of your current career. At the hiring process one of the most commonly asked questions by employees is can an interviewer not ask?. That is what details about the employee is not necessary to disclose when job hunting. Well in most cases questions can’t escape the scope of what is relevant to the position you are applying for skills and employment history. Outside of this is essentially just what feels correct but some obvious discussion topics that should be omitted are questions regarding sexual orientation religious affiliation. Interactions with the law in the past as arrests that don’t result in an actual conviction also do not have to be disclosed. If still in the application process an employer does have the right to request a drug test. Not conforming to these requests will most certainly lead to the job seeker to not get hired. After being hired drug tests work slightly differently. In most cases there has to be probable cause for a requested drug test unless your job has an already indicated requirement for random drug screenings. Another common question is I be fired without reason?. The answer to this is complicated and changes from state to state. In general you can be fired for any reason as long as there is one. In Texas for example an employer has the right to fire or demote an employee at will. This is to protect a business interest as an employee’s wages versus work become unprofitable the company can fire that employee without repercussions. This however isn’t true if you feel you’ve been discriminated against. If you feel like you’ve been fired for an invalid reason such as a refusing a sexual offer from a coworker or refusing to work off the clock contact a Waco personal injury attorney immediately. You have rights too and with proper representation you can restore those rights and punish those that abused them. Read more.. Home. 506 queries in 0.424 seconds.

For context this happened in Oklahoma I was in a car accident back in August. I had the right of way and someone in the oncoming lane failed to yield and turned in front of me. She was at a stop at the green light I don’t know and I was going 30 thinking she was yielding. As I crossed through the intersection she turned in front of me totaling my car and leaving me with injuries that took me out of academic work and a sports season. I have been cleared of all fault by the police. Now here come the issues I hope you can help with.. The driver of the vehicle was not covered by the car owner’s insurance. The driver was an unemployed 20 year old sister to the owner. The owner had an insurance card although she had canceled her insurance. So therefore she had no insurance at the time of the accident but received no ticket from the police because her card said she was still covered. After the incident I went to the station with evidence and they said they didn’t feel like writing her a ticket so they won’t. Right around the time of the accident the owner and her sisters driver being one of them moved to a new location. I can’t seem to find out where. I have found many addresses for her but they are either all old or false. I had to go to the doctor 6 times over head injuries. Her insurance was supposed to cover it. But of course with no insurance there’s no money to cover that. My car is still in the tow yard as I cannot afford to get it out. It’s racking up fees daily. I am still without a vehicle as mine was totaled. I spoke to a lawyer and she said suing the driver would be useless as you can’t suck blood from a stone. Suing the owner could be fruitful as she works for the casino in town. However I am a 21 year old college student and I really don’t know what to do at this point. I have bills from the accident piling up that I have yet to pay. I don’t want to go through the process of suing her if I may not get enough money back to make it worth while. I was told I could potentially talk to her in person to see if I could settle out of court but I can’t track her down. Anyone with legal knowledge or have been in a similar situation please help me out. I want to get this resolved as soon as possible. Thank you for your time reading this long post. Home.

I do not believe that an injury is the reason or at least the sole reason for Orton’s 6 month absence. He has been jobbing to damn near everybody for the past two months an I got very suspicious as to why Super Orton was losing matches regularly. I believe WWE has known about Orton failing a drug test of some sort and decided to punish him for it get other superstars over by having him job to them getting suspended for an elongated period of time. I also believe in anticipation of this WWE made Sheamus into the super power winning machine that he is now. They’re plan was to have Sheamus win everything while fading Orton from being as unstoppable as he once was. Superstars as big as Orton don’t lost frequently without reason. This is a cover up so that once of their biggest superstars doesn’t get tainted. Home. This year has been a busy one. We thank everyone who took the time to read any of our posts.

I am currently engaged\, to my ex boyfriend’s best friend. He was there for me when my ex wasn’t and was sick of seeing me with deadbeats. Well here I am a month later a whole 10 hrs between break up with ex and accepting engagement i think I am pregnant. I bought a test tonight going to take it tomorrow. BUT it would be my ex boyfriends baby. My fiance understands this and accepts it and still wants me to let my ex be a part of teh baby’s life have no problem with that The other part of this\,\, my fiance adn I don’t live together. We are both inbetween jobs had a severe back injury and am still rehabilitating and we live an hour apart from each other. I seriously feel like he is hiding something from me. His ex gf texted me the other day and we got to talking well she thinks she is preg too and it would be my fiances 100 expect him to be a part of that child’s life. Her and I have been tag-teaming and catching him in lies. For some reason if any other man would have pulled this on me I would have been gone a long time ago but I am still with him and fighting tooth and nail to make it work. I don’t care if he his friends with or texts or hangs out with other girls teh part that bugs me is that he is a major flirt and doesn’t let me know when he is with them and will ignore me when i try to get ahold of him. Any time I try to talk to him about HOW I FEEL he just says i’m being a whiney and need to stop because i nothing to worry about but EVERYTHING he does makes me suspicious. On top of it all I’m already depressed and lately its just been worse. I’m at the point now where i am seriously considering checking myself into a mental health hospital even though I can’t afford it. I am sick and damn tired of being in a losing battle. idfk where i’m going with this i just really need to get some outside opinions. If I end up breaking it off with him I will raise my child alone. Neither man will be a part of their life because honestly I think its for the best that they are in a calm and drama free environment. My fiance has made it perfectly clear that he DOES want a family and DOES want to be with me but I honestly don’t believe him. If he truly loved me and cared about me he would not want to see me like this and would actually LISTEN to me instead of being the douchefuck that he is. I am sick and damn tired of spinning my wheels. This may sound contradictory but I am a fighter. I will never give up but at the same time I won’t beat a dead horse. There is only so much I can do on my own and it takes us BOTH to make a relationship work. Home. State is Virginia. I am a big guy 6’4 250 pounds muscular. I have boxing and martial arts experience. And at 22 youth is on my side. I know that for most people crimes will severely hinder employment in the future. However I have no job I drive to Atlantic City every other weekend and play poker professionally. I made $69\,000 last year I didn’t even make this my career until March) and if all goes according to my current averages I’ll break 6 figures in 2012. I have a nestegg from savings plus an inheritence that would last me at least 5 years so if I go a few months without making money it won’t be a problem. Therefore I have no need for a job and there’s no one to fire me if I commit an assault on a person I hate. So I can commit an assault without losing my income and lifestyle and most likely\,the other person cannot. And that also means the victim would be hard pressed to collect if they sued me. Here in Virginia all the civil courts ever really do for unpaid judgements is to garnish my wages.... oh wait a minute. Exactly. Who’s going to garnish me the casinos So lets say that I not in anyway premeditated but I get into an argument with someone and get pissed and decide to kick their No serious or permanent injuries just give them a black eye or two and maybe a bruised rib. You know an everyday fight sided as it would be Having no criminal history what am I likely to get for a first offence of knocking someone across the room Would it be safe to say that I’d be arrested pay my bail and be released with a court date and maybe be sentenced to probation and community service a slap on the wrist that would make the whole thing worth it Afterall the career hinderence of a misdemeanor conviction is usually worse that the court punishment and again I don’t have a boss to worry about. Bearing in mind that affording an excellent attorney is not a problem for me by the way.

He didnt have any insurance and so a lie had been placed on his medical records.. the ER did not know that he had just been in an accident. But his injuries were all internal. He had a compression fracture of a vertebrae in his back.. pretty much a broken back.. and they did other tests but never really said anything else was wrong. He was sent on his way with pain medicine and said that they couldnt do anything for the broken back. Well he suffered from so many injuries its hard to list. His shoulder is completely wacked he likely broke ribs and his hips were messed up. But he was never treated. He never got insurance and never took care of himself. Through the last couple years he has attempted to get help but was denied medicare. He has been to doctors and he thinks they dismiss him because he has no insurance. He has lost so much weight and had been compensating for a bad back that everything else continued to be out of wack hips knees shoulder ribs etc. He did have an emergency where he just couldnt walk anymore and ended up getting surgery for one ruptured disk and the disk above and below were not ruptured but were inflamed. He somewhat got better from that.. but now has so many bills its not even funny. And his back may be healed but the rest of his body is still very crippled. He hasnt been able to work. He has been in such chronic severe pain that he is hard to be around. He is short tempered and very depressed. If it were not for my mother he would be homeless.. actually let me add to that he recently had conflicts with my mother and is not staying with her and has mooved into a friends house who has younger children and is in no place to be supporting him. He has been in so much pain that he has not been able to work. He does not get workers comp. As I said before he cant get approved for medicare. He is so thin and malnurished that he is constantly cold. He is barely skin and bones and looks skeletal. Its discusting. He has been trying to get out and find a job but it has been too cold lately and he says he has a hard time regulating his body temperature and when its cold its just not worth the pain to move from the house. He says it takes a good hour of stretching each morning just to get moving. But now he tells me he has blood in his stool. He has had this for over a month now. A year ago he had a bad stomach issue where he was throwing up and had such pains that he went to the hospital. They did a colonoskpy and removed polyps and said that there was twisting and folds in his colon... but that was a year ago. So today I dont know what to tell him. He tells me he has bright red blood in his stool.. but he has no doctor to go to and the er is likely to turn him away saying he just needs to see a doctor. He has no income and is in so much pain. I wish there was some kind of rehabilitation hospital for him to go to. They could do other surgery to fix some of his other ailments there literally is a bone sticking up from his shoulder and he does not have full movement out of it and it hurts Im sure some doctor could do something for him. But what doctor or hospital will see him all the way through to being healthy again I just want my brother back. He used to ride dirt bikes rock climb hike camp fish play paint ball go hunting.. but none of that now. He stays hunkered up in a basement with layers of clothes on and hates the world because no one will help him. Is there some hospital in Colorado or Doctor that takes on pro bono cases or something?. Can anyone give me any suggestions on how to help I am out of state and just want to help my brother. Thanks in advance for any response. Feel free to ask questions.. I really summed up his issues and he could go on for days about what all ailments he has... oh yeah like his bleeding/rotting wisdom teeth that need to be removed He didnt choose to be homeless/insurance less/job less.. he is in so much pain he cant get a job to get the insurance and then once he may get insurance he is not likely to get any wages because he is in so much debt that they will likely garnish his wages. If it werent for family and this one friend.. he literally would be just like the local homeless guy on the corner That scares me and its so sad. Home.

I am good at one thing an that is soccer but when I moved here I found out that there isn’t a soccer team within miles of this awful place. It is a college town of only 3000 ppl. My dad took the only thing that I loved away from me. He is a golf pro so he expects me to play. I have a horse but nobody teaches my style of riding. They took everything from me when we moved. I went to school and found out nobody wanted me there. Within days there were rumors. I didn’t say anything I just went on. I recently had an injury that prevented me from running so I had to quit two sports and quarter grades came out an I have a 3.8 GPA. I feel like failed because I expect more out of myself. My mom doesn’t care for me she never tells me she loves me she cringes when I give her a hug. It’s obvious tht she doesn’t want me and that I was a mistake. We argue constantly. Nobody wants me. I hate ppl now especially these people. I don’t understand what’s keeping me here I would rather die. I went to a catholic school I pray and god doesn’t answer. I cry constantly. I don’t understand what’s keeping me here. I guess it’s death. But I know I would never be missed. I hate life because I don’t see a point to mine anymore. Why am I being punished.

Terms of UseAbout Contact Us Free Stuff FTC Notice Privacy Dysfunctional relationship??. ?your opinion Do you perceive any real love\,dedication in this marriage They are the strangest couples i have ever come across. Husband 31 and is famous and very wealthy. i mean this guy ever since he started dating this woman\,had been repeatedly cheating on her\,sometimes harassing female co workers sexually\,getting infatuated with other ladies\,going on dates with other women\,making semi nude women sit on his lap and he always got himself photographed while doing all this.even after marriage hes been caught cheating with a fellow co worker and a friend he used to do drugs and stopped breathing and the fiance called the ambulance. But then why is he cheating always and how come shes always unperturbed by it??. She spends her days getting photographed with her friends clearly showing no concern\,enjoying his fame\,luxury and status. who blatantly posts pictures of herself and her dozen girl friends in bars\,restaurants\,bedrooms\,stadiums\,beachâ€ all over social networking sites and is least bothered about what he does.always clicking her pictures.in weird postures. she doesn’t even spend much time with her child and spend s her time getting photographed with her friends The husband openly thrashed the fellow co worker(one of his best friends her publicly on radio for being a and the 10 men he knows.she slept with.and who she must be sleeping with while hes talking mentioning wife saying what he put her through when stopped breathing after he overdosed on drugs 6 years ago and the wife has no effect. when he did drugs 6 years ago she did nothing to help him(no rehab\,no counseling only dressing up dainty and coming to events with him)as normally people would do\,instead when he overdosed and stopped breathing then she called the ambulance?. !what the heck?. BUT when she went to watch him perform she moved away from him\,the moment she saw him coming near her even though he wasn’t even coming towards her.she said something and moved away immediately.HOW CAN A WIFE SHIFT AWAY AT THE SIGHT OF HER OWN HUSBAND!!!. They kiss in the crowds only when the husband can\,and when lots of people see otherwise the woman sits backstage And he keeps lying on twitter about what a family man he is And then on twitter he keeps saying things about her like shes back on twitter(as people had said horrible things to her calling her a gold digger so she left)showing her photo with her friends on twitter that she went to a Saturday night show saying happy birthday to me on twitter when we live together time needed to be with family after he took a break from work(everything on twitter Like spreading news that they are going to Bahamas for a family vacation when he took a break three weeks ago. On wife’s birthday Jan but didn’t mention that they were going on her birthday instead wrote happy birthday to her on his account on twitter when they live together!.the only thing he does is loving his daughter.he loves kid though. They don’t even talk much and my relative is always busy with his daughter.and usually the wife is absent from the father-daughter play time. she also behaves very formally with her daughter too. and keeps clicking her pix only. whats this crap??. what is their problem is?. do they actually like each other???. what sort of relationship is this?. will it end badly or nicely hes my relative. answers only please Home Related Posts What Was The 70′s Bank-heist Film Title Where Why Do Wealthy Christians Think The Homeless Dont Have Real Actual Paying Jobs...?are Other Religions Snobs I M Depressed Coz My Gf Ditched Me..what Do I Do Nw??????. ?girls Help Me....

Comparison of outcomes between robotic-assisted laparoscopic surgery and conventional laparoscopic surgery for colorectal disease Several studies have shown that new surgical techniques have the potential of improving outcomes following colorectal surgery. Robotic-assisted laparoscopic surgery has emerged as a viable option for colorectal procedures offering various visual and operative advantages. The purpose of the this study is to compare short-term and pathology outcomes in patients that undergo colorectal surgery either with robotic-assisted laparoscopic surgery or conventional laparoscopic surgery. This study involves gathering anonymous data from patient records in order to compare and evaluate the efficacy of this new surgical approach with an established surgical technique. Comparison of outcomes between single-site laparoscopic surgery and conventional laparoscopic surgery for colectomy Single-site or single-incision laparoscopic surgery offers many potential advantages for the surgical treatment of colorectal diseases. This minimally invasive laparoscopic technique is performed entirely through the umbilicus and results in minimal scar with diminished pain. This trial will compare the clinical outcomes of single-site laparoscopic surgery with those obtained through conventional laparoscopic surgery of the colon and rectum. Assessment of quality of life following minimally invasive colorectal surgery Minimally invasive surgery has emerged as a viable option for the treatment of benign and malignant colorectal disease. Comparisons of intra-operative results and post-operative outcomes have been well documented in the literature. While comparisons between laparoscopic and open surgery are well reported there are few if any reports of comparisons between the different types of minimally invasive surgery conventional hand-assisted single-incision or robotic-assisted laparoscopic surgery. Short and long-term outcomes with regard to quality of life are seldom reported following any surgical procedure. The purpose of this study is to assess QOL outcomes through completed questionnaires in patients undergoing minimally invasive surgery for colorectal disease. Read more..

Is what you are eating everyday affecting your health Is your daily diet extending your life or shortening your life The answer is either yes or no. I feel the urge to share some important information with you that can help you live a healthier and longer life. As a consummate reader I am constantly reading books on self-help and health. I am currently reading a great book on the current state of our health and what is causing our health problems and numerous deaths due to different types of cancer breast cancer and liver cancer. This book clarifies the confusion around our daily diet and the danger of our consumption of high levels of protein and fat from animal based products. The more I read this book the more I realize that we are causing our own illness. The level of all types of cancers and diseases are higher in the industrial world especially in the western world. The level of all types of cancers are approximately three times higher in the industrialized nations where high level of animal based products are consumed as to that of Asian and non-industrialized nations where their diet is mainly plant based. I think vegetarians are way ahead of the curve in practicing good diet and maybe we should take a page from their book. Our health totally depends on the type diet that we follow and the amount of our daily physical activity. We need to be conscientious of the amount and the quality of food that we take in especially if the source is animal based. We need to decrease the amount of animal based protein and fat that we consume and get more of our protein and fat from plant based products. Don’t take my word for it and read the book China Study and you will see what I am talking about. This book was referred to me by Shawn Brodof the author of Termite Effect” a business coach from Charlotte NC your information here is a video and a book link you can get his book In this book China Study” you will discover the dangers and the lack of success in any of the fad diets. They don’t work for the long hall and they even cause health problems that you are not aware of. For example the Atkins diet doesn’t really work and you could not sustain this diet forever. To top it off it is dangerous to consume all of that protein and fat from animal based products. Atkins himself was an obese man with hearth disease and high blood pressure and who died promoting his unhealthy diet that finally took him to the grave. Again you don’t have to listen to me just read the book and it will open your eyes. Here is the link where you can get the book This book is great and you will thank yourself for reading it and your family will thank you. Also you need to look at your vitamin supplements to see if they are plant based or animal based. I will share with you the vitamin supplements that I take because they are plant based. I am not selling the products I just use them.

Although the patient may possibly have an enlarged gland the signs and symptoms can in some cases be confused as to whether this is benign prostatic hyperplasia. Only in situations where it is unquestionably necessary might a medical doctor recommend surgery is required. A good medical doctor will look for non-surgical treatments first. Patients who return with a alternate prognosis may not fare so well. Medical doctors will suggest chemotherapy non-invasive procedures or prostate cancer surgery depending on how far the cancer has extended and the measurements of the tumor. He may recommend a laparoscopic prostatectomy The patient usually takes some time to digest the news. No one ever wishes to hear the primary prognosis and the subsequent recommendation typically causes a person to get a deeper level of shock. Read more.. Home. Malignant mesothelioma is a rare cancer that occurs in the thin layer of tissue that covers the majority of your internal organs Doctors divide mesothelioma into different types based on what part of the mesothelium is affected.Mesothelioma most often affects the tissue that surrounds the lungs This type is called pleural malignant mesothelioma. Other rarer types of mesothelioma affect tissue in the abdomen around the heart and around the testicles.Mesothelioma is an aggressive and deadly form of cancer. Mesothelioma treatments are available but for many people with mesothelioma a cure is not possible. Instead treatment for mesothelioma is often focused on keeping you as comfortable as possible. In general cancer begins when a series of genetic mutations occur within a cell causing the cell to grow and multiply out of control. It isn’t clear what causes the initial genetic mutations that lead to mesothelioma though researchers have identified factors that may increase the risk. It’s likely that cancers form because of an interaction between many factors such as inherited conditions your environment your health conditions and your lifestyle choices. Mesothelioma doesn’t include a noncancerous tumor. A form of noncancerous tumor that can occur in the chest is sometimes called benign mesothelioma. However this name is misleading.Benign mesothelioma doesn’t begin in the same cells where the cancerous forms of mesothelioma begin. And in a minority of cases benign mesothelioma can be very aggressive despite the term For this reason some doctors now refer to this tumor as solitary fibrous tumor. Read more.. Home. The Cure for Cancer. I receive many emails asking for me to pray for the cure for cancer and always see people doing sponsored events to raise funds for research to find the cure. But do we not already know what cure is. Apparently everyone has cancer cells or pre-cancerous cells in their body and the body’s immune system disposes of these naturally.

We must be aware that bladder stones are those solid crystals which develop in the urinary balder. They cause symptoms like pain in lower abdomen and more importantly difficulty in passing urine. The testing and treatment of the same is important to avoid further complications and infections. Along with test like the x-rays a rectal examination may also be carried out. Basically while testing for bladder stones the medical healthcare experts generally examine the entire body to ensure that there is no other cause for the symptoms. The first step is radiography by way of x-rays which may confirm the presence of stones. For further clarification cystoscopy may be performed. This is an endoscope procedure where the medical device is entered into the body through the urethra. The urinary bladder is then examined. In this case since it is a diagnostic procedure the individual may be administered only local anesthesia. In operative methods general anesthesia may be required. The urine sample is also analyzed because when bladder stones develop they also affect the concentration and composition of the urine which is to be removed out of the body. Various compounds present in the urine are chemically and physically tested. The examination is also carried out at the microscopic level.Â The physical testing reports the basic coloration and appearance. A urine specific gravity test may be performed to understand the dilution of the urine. While the chemical test confirms the substance present the microscopic test confirms whether there are any suspicious germs mucous or crystals. The health and nature of the cells can be determined. Additionally the urine culture tests confirm if any bacteria are harbored in the excretory liquid. In adults and children this test helps in confirming the presence or absence of infections. This is useful because the information aids the course of action for cure. Read more.. Home.

I told her that this sounded equivalent to believing and visualizing that your cancer will go away and the next day its gone. she said there are all kinds of moms who did this and had exactly what they visualized...I kind of dont believe her and think she sounds nuts. shes all mother nature and thinks the universe controls things and believes in healing power and energy healing people. if that was true then you think my moms cancer would be gone by now..... what are your thoughts on this Related Posts Can You Assess My Health Hereditary/environmental Factors Why Dont People Agree With Insurance Coverage Of Birth Control Can You Help Me Out Without This Query To Do With A Possible Stroke Home.

Filed under News. Former WEC middleweight champion Paulo Filho says he is ready to close the book on his competitive MMA career. In a recent interview with Brazil’s Tatame Filho says he plans on retiring after his Nov. 26 fight at KSW 17 against Mamed Khalidov if that fight even happens. may fight in November because I already signed the contract after that I will retire\, he tells Tatame. don’t want this anymore.. In his prime in 2006-2007 Filho was widely considered to be the No. 2 middleweight in the world just under Anderson Silva. But since the two are friends a fight between the two never went past what-if discussions by fans and media. At the time Silva touted Filho as the best middleweight in the world. After going 16-0 in the first seven years of his career Filho suffered his first loss at WEC 36 against Chael Sonnen and never quite recovered. His battles with depression and substance abuse the Tatame interview Filho said his only drug issue was with rohypnol a prescription sedative had impacted his work inside the cage. Following the loss to Sonnen Filho was not picked up by the UFC and has since compiled a 6-3-2 record. In his last fight Filho fought Satoshi Ishii to a draw a decision rendered by what appeared to be partisan judges in the Brazilian event. Filho himself after the fight said Ishii should have been awarded the win. Past the Nov. 26 fight the 33-year-old Filho is unsure of what he wants to do next. But it’s not MMA. not thinking about that right now but I don’t wanna know about fighting anymore\, Filho said. had good and horrible moments. I did what I could it’s over. I was far from what I could have been but I’m satisfied. It’s over.

Pineda submitted Pat Schilling in January in his UFC debut winning his sixth straight fight overall.

Jon Jones vs. Rashad Evans Official for ATL. UFC 143 Medical Suspensions Carlos Condit Among 15 Fighters Suspended. Post navigation. Archives. Meta. By Brad Walker MMATorch Contributor Here’s how this works I am going to look at a number of factors that can affect the value of each title currently being held and defended inside the UFC. I will list the factors pros and cons and numbers behind each title this will lead me to a final score the level of prestige that comes with winning the title as compared to the others the numerical value of the title on a scale of 1 to 100. UFC Heavyweight Championship Created February 7 1997 First Champion Mark Hammer Coleman Total Number Of Reigns 16 Including Interim Titles Most Reigns 2 Couture Times Successfully Defended 12 Longest Reign 1\,113 Days Couture The Heavyweight Title is generally considered to be the most prestigious in all of fighting regardless of what organization it is in. I understand the consensus behind that but I don’t necessarily agree with it. Many top level competitors have held this belt including Bas Rutten Randy Couture Tim Sylvia Brock Lesnar and Frank Mir. It has clearly been held by a number of current and future hall of famers and that certainly adds some shine to the gold. I think the most dominant champion would probably be considered to be Brock Lesnar as he came saw and conquered then defended it twice to tie the record of most defenses. Given all of the factors and removing the general field of thought the numbers speak volumes about the title. Although there have been 16 undisputed champions the title has only been defended successfully 12 times. This means that a defending heavyweight champion has a 25 chance of losing the belt in his first defense with a decrease to 20 if you count the interim reigns. It is certainly one of the hardest titles to hold onto with an increasingly dangerous division this belt certainly lends some serious swagger to its holder. Total Value Out Of 100 86 It’s a hard title to win and it’s an even harder title to keep that definitely increases its value. It is considered to be the most sought after title in the UFC and for good reason it means you’re the biggest baddest and scariest guy in the world of mixed martial arts. That doesn’t mean its actual value should be increased that’s why I have put it at an 86 because it’s definitely a title everyone wants but it is also a title that if you get in a match for it you have a reasonable chance of getting it. UFC Light-Heavyweight Championship Created December 21 1997 First Champion Frank Shamrock Total Number Of Reigns 12 Counting Interim Most Reigns 3 Couture Times Successfully Defended 17 Longest Reign 1\,260 Days Ortiz This title has a fantastic history originally being called the middleweight title until it was renamed in 2001 with the adoption of the unified rules. A large majority of its time has been spent around the waist of current or future hall of famers perhaps more than any other title in the UFC. I have many fond memories of its defenses and the feuds that went along with them most notably Chuck Liddell and Tito Ortiz. There were a number of times that I believed this title would never change hands for instance once Rampage won the belt I figured this is it this guy’s a monster. Fate has a funny way of moving the title and no way could be funnier than Forrest Griffin’s leg kick domination of Rampage. Some of the title reigns feeling like flukes do affect the value of the title but I believe as it stands having a champion who is an absolute monster like Jon Jones will only serve to raise the value. Total Value Out Of 100 78 I only have it as low as 78 because of how hard the past champions have fallen. Chuck Tito and Forrest have all become afterthoughts in the world of MMA and it’s for the best as they are clearly past their respective primes. The fact that it’s highly defended certainly brought the number up quite a bit but now that Jon Jones has his hands on the belt and holding down the throne I would expect to see a great increase over the next year or two. UFC Middleweight Championship Created September 28 2001 First Champion Dave Menne Total Number Of Reigns 5 Most Reigns Nobody has held this title twice Times Successfully Defended 12 Longest Reign 1\,939 Days Silva It certainly works in this title’s favor that it has the best pound for pound fighter in the world wearing it around his waist and he has been for over five years now. He is clearly the most dominant champion in UFC history and adds such a large amount of value to this belt. Sure most people look at the name Dave Menne and go the heck is that?. And I don’t blame them the guy is truly an after-thought in the MMA world but that’s no fault of his own he was the inaugural champion after all. The title started gaining its value when Rich Franklin took it from Evan Tanner in 2005 and ever since it has been the hardest title to get your hands on. Did I mention that Anderson Silva is the best fighter on the planet and will probably retire holding this belt In 10 years of existence this belt has only had five champions the most recent owner has had it for half of its lifespan This is the hardest to attain belt in mixed martial arts right now and for good reason as the champion should be considered MMA royalty. Total Value Out Of 100 97 The only thing that could raise the value of this belt is having the first two champions erased from the record and start the title history with a fighter like Evan Tanner. When Evan Tanner passed away in 2008 he felt he had gone flat inside the cage but he did lose the title to Rich Franklin a future hall of famer. This belt doesn’t have the lengthy history that the others do but that’s exactly why it’s the most coveted belt in the world. UFC Welterweight Championship Created October 16th 1998 First Champion Pat Miletich Total Number Of Reigns 8 counting Interim belts Most Reigns 2 GSP and Matt Hughes Times Successfully Defended 17 Longest Reign 1\,363 Days This title has almost exclusively been held by current and future members of the UFC Hall of Fame with the exception of Carlos Newton and Matt Serra. Starting with Pat Miletich and moving to Georges St-Pierre this title has been on the waist of some of the greatest fighters in MMA history. GSP is clearly the second best pound for pound fighter in the world and since regaining the title in 2008 has showed an unmatched brilliance inside of the cage. Between GSP Hughes and Miletich you have every title defense ever in the history of this belt. B.J. Penn also notably held this title in 2004 before being stripped for making the jump to K-1. There has not been a lot of controversy around this belt and I don’t currently believe anyone in the division is going to get it off of the current champ anytime soon. If it winds up in the hands of Nick Diaz or Carlos Condit and they have a one and done type of reign the value will drop. Total Value Out Of 100 89 The fact that GSP looks like a vulnerable champion right now with only two solid contenders left in the division took away some overall points but the division although the top tier looks a little crowded isn’t as deep as it could be because St-Pierre has already beaten almost anybody who he could fight for the title aside from Diaz and Condit and possibly Johny Hendricks. I expect to see it around the waist of GSP for a couple of more years before someone manages to take it away. UFC Lightweight Championship Created Feb 23 2001 First Champion Jens Pulver Total Number Of Reigns 4 Most Reigns Nobody has held this title twice Times Successfully Defended 8 with 1 draw. Longest Reign 812 Days Penn This title has had kind of an odd history the first champion was stripped of the title and then a four man tournament was held which ended in a draw. It was then left vacant until 2006 when it was captured by Sean Sherk who was in turn stripped of the title for testing positive for steroids. After that things kind of evened out with B.J. Penn taking the title to some prominence and Frankie Edgar also lending a hand to the value. I don’t know if I believe that Edgar will still be the champion after UFC 144 and his bout with Ben Henderson because things in the lightweight division are really churning up right now. There are so many powerful prospects and top notch contenders are lying in wait for a shot at the belt. Total Value Out Of 100 65 There are just so many stains on the history of this belt that it’s hard to give it a promising value. It was stripped from the first two champions and B.J. Penn’s downfall hasn’t exactly added value to the legitimacy of past champions. I would love to see a truly dominant fighter get his hands on this belt and defend it for years on end like GSP or Silva have with their belts. That is about the only way to get the overall value of this title increased for all I know Frankie Edgar could be the guy to take this title up to the 80′s or 90′s in value but as it stands he has to get past Benson Henderson first. I am going to wait a few months to evaluate the Featherweight Bantamweight and Flyweight titles because their history is just beginning. to follow me on twitter I am always taking requests for writing topics and love to hear all of your comments on my columns. Source http://www.mmatorch.com/artman2/publish/Staff_Editorials_19/article_12457.shtml Tiki Ghosn Dennis George Kultar Gill Allan Goes Takanori The Fireball Kid Gomi Akihiro Gono Gabriel Gonzaga Lyman Good Gary Goodridge Gerard Gordeau Here’s how this works I am going to look at a number of factors that can affect the value of each title currently being held and defended inside the UFC. I will list the factors pros and cons and numbers behind each title this will lead me to a final score the level of prestige that comes with winning the title as compared to the others the numerical value of the title on a scale of 1 to 100. UFC Heavyweight Championship Created February 7 1997 First Champion Mark Hammer Coleman Total Number Of Reigns 16 Including Interim Titles Most Reigns 2 Couture Times Successfully Defended 12 Longest Reign 1\,113 Days Couture The Heavyweight Title is generally considered to be the most prestigious in all of fighting regardless of what organization it is in. I understand the consensus behind that but I don’t necessarily agree with it. Many top level competitors have held this belt including Bas Rutten Randy Couture Tim Sylvia Brock Lesnar and Frank Mir. It has clearly been held by a number of current and future hall of famers and that certainly adds some shine to the gold. I think the most dominant champion would probably be considered to be Brock Lesnar as he came saw and conquered then defended it twice to tie the record of most defenses. Given all of the factors and removing the general field of thought the numbers speak volumes about the title. Although there have been 16 undisputed champions the title has only been defended successfully 12 times. This means that a defending heavyweight champion has a 25 chance of losing the belt in his first defense with a decrease to 20 if you count the interim reigns. It is certainly one of the hardest titles to hold onto with an increasingly dangerous division this belt certainly lends some serious swagger to its holder. Total Value Out Of 100 86 It’s a hard title to win and it’s an even harder title to keep that definitely increases its value. It is considered to be the most sought after title in the UFC and for good reason it means you’re the biggest baddest and scariest guy in the world of mixed martial arts. That doesn’t mean its actual value should be increased that’s why I have put it at an 86 because it’s definitely a title everyone wants but it is also a title that if you get in a match for it you have a reasonable chance of getting it. UFC Light-Heavyweight Championship Created December 21 1997 First Champion Frank Shamrock Total Number Of Reigns 12 Counting Interim Most Reigns 3 Couture Times Successfully Defended 17 Longest Reign 1\,260 Days Ortiz This title has a fantastic history originally being called the middleweight title until it was renamed in 2001 with the adoption of the unified rules. A large majority of its time has been spent around the waist of current or future hall of famers perhaps more than any other title in the UFC. I have many fond memories of its defenses and the feuds that went along with them most notably Chuck Liddell and Tito Ortiz. There were a number of times that I believed this title would never change hands for instance once Rampage won the belt I figured this is it this guy’s a monster. Fate has a funny way of moving the title and no way could be funnier than Forrest Griffin’s leg kick domination of Rampage. Some of the title reigns feeling like flukes do affect the value of the title but I believe as it stands having a champion who is an absolute monster like Jon Jones will only serve to raise the value. Total Value Out Of 100 78 I only have it as low as 78 because of how hard the past champions have fallen. Chuck Tito and Forrest have all become afterthoughts in the world of MMA and it’s for the best as they are clearly past their respective primes. The fact that it’s highly defended certainly brought the number up quite a bit but now that Jon Jones has his hands on the belt and holding down the throne I would expect to see a great increase over the next year or two.

HANSEN The Ballad of John and Yoko John Were Carlos Condit and Yoko Were Nick Diaz. Stephen Thompson Karate’s Back 2.0. Post navigation. Archives. Meta. By Jamie Penick MMATorch Editor-in-Chief It appears Tito Ortiz will indeed get his third fight with Forrest Griffin sometime this year a fight he says will be his last. UFC owner Lorenzo Fertitta in the midst of a lengthy question and answer session on Twitter early this morning said that the fight with Ortiz would be next for Griffin when asked by a curious fan. He didn’t give a date for the fight but it will come sometime in the next several months. Ortiz and Griffin first met back at UFC 59 in 2006. At the time Griffin had won three fights to kickstart his UFC career and the bout with Ortiz was his first step into the upper echelon of the UFC’s light heavyweight division. He would lose that fight by split decision but still had a good showing as he came back from diversity and arguably took the final two rounds of the fight. It would be another three and a half years before they would meet again this time in the main event of UFC 106 in November of 2009. Ortiz was returning to the UFC after a lengthy hiatus due to a contract dispute and several injuries while Griffin had gone through a roller-coaster 14 months. In that stretch he had captured the UFC Light Heavyweight Championship then lost it to Rashad Evans before getting blitzed by Anderson Silva the summer before the second meeting. In that fight Griffin returned the split decision favor in another close bout evening up the series at one apiece. Griffin has gone 1-1 since that second meeting most recently losing to Mauricio Rua at UFC 134. Ortiz has gone 1-3 since that second meeting and rides into his final fight on a two-fight losing streak and his only TKO losses to anyone but Chuck Liddell. Penick’s Analysis I’m not wholly interested in a third fight between the two especially since it doesn’t mean much for Griffin in this situation. However as he’s not necessarily on his way towards a title shot anytime soon this is a marquee fight and a chance to gain an advantage in the series. For Ortiz it’s his one last opportunity to get a win to close out his career and he feels he can defeat Griffin so it’s a fight that makes sense to him.

As it stands right now Carlos Condit is the Interim UFC Welterweight Champion and Georges St-Pierre is the full-fledged UFC Welterweight Champion. I know I know. Breaking news you’re welcome. It’s very obvious that Dana White Georges St-Pierre and Nick Diaz all want to see St-Pierre vs. Diaz for the title. Of course Carlos Condit went and mucked up that plan by going out there and you know winning. So as a result of that ever-so-unpleasant happenstance we’re looking at Condit vs. St-Pierre or Condit versus Ellenberger or Sanchez or Koscheck might eventually lead to Koscheck versus GSP III or Hendricks I mean yawn. So what’s a promoter looking to make his first dollar to do Let me tell you a story. A true story. Names have been changed to protect the innocent. And.. the guilty. In 2007 there was a guy named.. let’s call him Tall Guy who always wore this really tacky Shiny Gold Belt every time he went out in public and it totally didn’t go with any of his shoes. But Tall Guy didn’t let that stop him from wearing his twenty pounds of gold out to dinner contract signings and the such. Tall Guy was given this Shiny Gold Belt by Rich Bald Guy but Rich Bald Guy didn’t expect to see Tall Guy wearing the damn thing with him 24 hours a day ya dig Unfortunately even though Rich Bald Guy technically owned the Shiny Gold Belt he couldn’t just up and take it back because then the lawyers would get involved and Stan Marsh would yell shenanigans and then there would be drama and attention and the such. Rich Bald Guy needed a mercenary. Enter Old Guy. Old Guy used to work for Rich Bald Guy but he put himself out to pasture a year prior. Old Guy decided he could beat Tall Guy so Rich Bald Guy was all about that. Old Guy beat up Tall Guy and Rich Bald Guy gave Old Guy the Shiny Gold Belt and all was well with life the universe and everything. Hairy Back Guy tried to steal the Shiny Gold Belt but failed miserably and all was extremely well with life the universe and everything. Unfortunately for Rich Bald Guy and for life the universe and everything Old Guy was in fact a mercenary. And being a mercenary one day he told Rich Bald Guy long and thanks for all the fish\, and out the door he went. With the Shiny Gold Belt no less. Horror of horrors Rich Bald Guy wanted nothing more than to get back his Shiny Gold Belt and if he was able to stick it to the mercenary Old Guy all the better. So he commissioned a goldsmith to make Shiny Gold Belt 2.0 and eventually he gave Shiny Gold Belt 2.0 to Brazilian Scar Dude. Rich Bald Guy then went out and told the world that Shiny Gold Belt 2.0 was better than that other Shiny Gold Belt and Old Guy can stick it. side note.. Adrien Brody would look a hundred times better if he took that Gilette Fusion Glider that he’s endorsing and shaved the hell out of his sideburns chin and upper lip as well. Just sayin. Back to the story. Old Guy knew his Shiny Gold Belt was the best Shiny Gold Belt and he wanted to get his hands on both Shiny Gold Belts. Apparently he’d then be able to meld the two Shiny Gold Belts into some form of Super Belt with magic powers or some such nonsense. I don’t know whatever I’m just telling you what I heard. So Old Guy says to Rich Bald Guy fight Brazilian Scar Dude and the winner gets to wear both belts. Deal?. So Rich Bald GuyÂ thought about that offer for about 30 seconds and remembering that his secondary goal was to it to Old Guy he had a message for Old Guy. Rich Bald Guy went up to Old Guy and said Old Guy. I think you can beat Brazilian Scar Dude and then what have you learned from all this Nothing. So I told Brazilian Scar Dude to show his Shiny Gold Belt to Cocky Dude in December. And you know even though I’m Rich Bald Guy it’s not like I can just change things with at the snap of my fingers which point they say Rich Bald guy busted out laughing for like ten minutes straight. So how about you hang out with Scandinavian Donkey Kong Man in November and maybe just maybe he won’t rip the Shiny Gold Belt from your cold dead hands?. Feeling he had no choice Old Guy walked into a room with Scandinavian Donkey Kong Man and gave the original Shiny Gold Belt to Scandinavian Donkey Kong Man. Eventually Scandinavian Donkey Kong Man and Cocky Dude went through with that whole melding of the Shiny Gold Belts thing and Shiny Gold Belt 2.0 seems to have disappeared. So what’s the point How does this tie in to the current UFC Welterweight mess Simple. Let Condit or anyone who might beat Condit defend the interim title as many times as he needs to until GSP is ready to return. Make sure that GSP returns at a time when Condit whoever is the Interim champion at that time is already booked. Then just book the fight you want to book GSP vs. Diaz for the real title winner faces the interim champion.

Given the overwhelming success of J.J. Abrams Trek\, much ado has been made over the sequel which started production not too long ago. One of the more interesting stories to come out of the flurry of activity surrounding the new film is the casting of rising star Benedict Cumberbatch as the chief villain. The very busy actor could only express his excitement about the project when MTV News caught up with him at the Golden Globes but co-star Chris Pine had a little bit more to offer about Cumberbatch’s contributions to the film thus far. is fantastic. He’s just so good\, Pine told MTV about his scenes with the British actor at the premiere of Means War. super talented and we are more than grateful to have him onboard. When asked about the tone of his scenes with the Tailor Soldier Spy and Horse actor Pine gushed about his co-star’s acting skills. has got this intensity about him and he’s obviously extremely intelligent and articulate. His vocal quality is something else. He obviously is unlike many of us like an actually trained actor\, Pine added with a laugh. actually studied for it. So what are we going to love about Cumberbatch’s performance And will it be love/hate since he’s playing a mysterious villain love everything. He’s really talented\, Pine said. think it’s all going to be love a mad amount of love. Another Trek 2′ actor Alice Eve was just as excited about Cumberbatch joining the team having worked with him previously on for 10. very excited to work with him again. He’s so very funny Ben\, she said. don’t know if you remember his character in for 10\, but he was so funny. Like King of the Geeks but he did it so well and I found a lot of that hard to get through because he was so funny. I like him very much. Check out everything we’ve got on Trek 2.

Chris Pine Photo Dominique Charriau/WireImage Given the overwhelming success of J.J. Abrams Trek\, much ado has been made over the sequel which started production not too long ago. One of the more interesting stories to come out of the flurry of activity surrounding the new film is the casting of rising star Benedict Cumberbatch as the chief villain. Given the overwhelming success of J.J. Abrams Trek\, much ado has been made over the sequel which started production not too long ago. One of the more interesting stories to come out of the flurry of activity surrounding the new film is the casting of rising star Benedict Cumberbatch as the chief villain. The very busy actor could only express his excitement about the project when MTV News caught up with him at the Golden Globes but co-star Chris Pine had a little bit more to offer about Cumberbatch’s contributions to the film thus far. is fantastic. He’s just so good\, Pine told MTV about his scenes with the British actor at the premiere of Means War. super talented and we are more than grateful to have him onboard. When asked about the tone of his scenes with the Tailor Soldier Spy and Horse actor Pine gushed about his co-star’s acting skills. has got this intensity about him and he’s obviously extremely intelligent and articulate. His vocal quality is something else. He obviously is unlike many of us like an actually trained actor\, Pine added with a laugh. actually studied for it. So what are we going to love about Cumberbatch’s performance And will it be love/hate since he’s playing a mysterious villain love everything. He’s really talented\, Pine said. think it’s all going to be love a mad amount of love. Another Trek 2′ actor Alice Eve was just as excited about Cumberbatch joining the team having worked with him previously on for 10. very excited to work with him again. He’s so very funny Ben\, she said. don’t know if you remember his character in for 10\, but he was so funny. Like King of the Geeks but he did it so well and I found a lot of that hard to get through because he was so funny. I like him very much. Check out everything we’ve got on Trek 2.

A skinny scruffy Macaulay Culkin resurfaced in N.Y. City yesterday and photos of him first posted on Entertainment Tonight have generated a lot of buzz online. A rep for the former child star slams speculation that the star is struggling in any way despite his dramatically thinner appearance. Check it out below. Macaulay Culkin Photos The rep said Culkin is in perfectly good health. For ET or any other media to speculate otherwise is thoughtless irresponsible and destructive.. Explains a source of the shocking Macaulay Culkin photos is just so thin naturally so when he loses one pound it just looks like more.. A second insider cautions that Culkin has had issues for years. Culkin and Friend with Benefits actress Mila Kunis called off their low-key eight-year relationship in late 2010. He has not personally addressed the photos.

They say the camera adds 10 pounds but there are exceptions to every rule. A skinny scruffy Macaulay Culkin resurfaced in N.Y. City yesterday and photos of him first posted on Entertainment Tonight have generated a lot of buzz online. A rep for the former child star slams speculation that the star is struggling in any way despite his dramatically thinner appearance. Check it out below. Macaulay Culkin Photos The rep said Culkin is in perfectly good health. For ET or any other media to speculate otherwise is thoughtless irresponsible and destructive.. Explains a source of the shocking Macaulay Culkin photos is just so thin naturally so when he loses one pound it just looks like more.. A second insider cautions that Culkin has had issues for years.

Along with Katherine Michael's siblings LaToya Jermaine Randy and Rebbie were also reportedly in attendance at the hearing. In regards to the sentence the family said in the statement respectfully request you impose a sentence that reminds physicians they cannot sell their services to the highest bidder. The judge agreed lamenting that due to a new California law to address overcrowding in prisons he was unable to sentence Murray to state prison. Stating that Murray practiced medicine and had no remorse\, Judge Michael Pastor declined the defense's motion for probation and handed down the stiffest sentence possible four years which Murray will most likely serve in a Los Angeles county jail or on home confinement. Upon leaving the courthouse Michael's brother Jermaine when asked if the four-year sentence was enough shook his head and said Katherine told local TV station KTLA years is not enough for someone's life. It won't bring him back. But at least he got the maximum and I thought the judge was very very fair.

The March 2012 meeting of Delaware Valley Americans United chapter’s Philadelphia Committee will take place on Thursday March 29th at 7pm in the Skyline Room on the 4th floor of the Parkway Central Library in Philadelphia PA at 1901 Vine Street 19th and 20th Streets on the Parkway. GOOD NEWS CLUB The Christian Right’s Stealth Assault on America’s Children by Katherine Stewart. Katherine Stewart will be on a national tour beginning January 24 2012 to discuss her new book about the Christian Rightâ€TMs stealth activity directed at Americaâ€TMs children. She will present her findings to the Delaware Valley Chapter of Americans United for Separation of Church and State at our regular bimonthly program meeting to be held on Thursday March 29 at 7pm in the Skyline Room on the 4th floor of the Free Library of Philadelphia Parkway Central Branch 19th Vine Streets Philadelphia PA. Stewart’s book GOOD NEWS CLUB The Christian Rightâ€TMs Stealth Assault on Americaâ€TMs Children is a powerful study of religious right activity in public schools. Michelle Goldberg author of Coming The Rise of Christian Nationalism and The Means of Reproduction says those well-versed in the religious rightâ€TMs attempt to Christianize American institutions will likely be shocked by The Good News Club. Katherine Stewartâ€TMs book about the fundamentalist assault on public education is lucid alarming and very important.â. In January 2009 Katherine Stewart learned that the Santa Barbara public elementary school her children attended had added a Bible study class called the News Clubâ to its afterschool program. Stewartâ€TMs curiosity turned to concern as she discovered that the unstated purpose of the club which is sponsored by the Child Evangelism Fellowship is to convey the impression to its young members and their schoolmates that their school favors a particular form of the Christian religion. She soon learned that the Good News Clubâ€”a seemingly spontaneous and voluntary after-school programâ€”was in fact part of a larger calculated initiative by national advocacy groups whose declared aim is to backâ Americaâ€TMs public schools and repurpose them with a Fundamentalist Christian agenda. What happened in Stewartâ€TMs community is happening nationwide. At the end of 2010 there were nearly 3\,500 Good News Clubs operating in public schools across the country a number that is rapidly increasingâ€”and the Good News Club is just one of many different initiatives with similar goals. Whatâ€TMs more a landmark 2001 Supreme Court ruling not only permits such an entanglement between schools and religion it effectively makes it obligatory. In The Good News Club The Christian Rightâ€TMs Stealth Assault on Americaâ€TMs Children Stewart sets out on an investigative journey to uncover the effect the Good News Clubs and similar initiatives have on our schools children and communities. She travels to dozens of cities and towns across the country and visits regions famous for their piety like west Texas and Alabama as well as places known for the opposite like Seattle and New York City. Everywhere she discovers religion-driven programs inserting themselves into public school systems with unprecedented force and unexpected consequences. Stewart takes us on a chilling narrative in which she. Interviews members of a community in Seattle that has been torn apart by the arrival of a Good News Club in their public school. Goes undercover to sit in on training sessions with instructors for the Good News Club which arms its local club leaders with Plan\,â a document hundreds of pages in length that details each step involved in setting up and maintaining a club including instructions on how to serve legal papers to a resistant superintendent and how to incentivize children to attend meetings. Visits student athletic programs that have been turned into vehicles for religious recruiting. Listens to the stories of children who have been subject to proselytizing in classrooms and school yards and speaks with other children who have been instructed to proselytize their friends at school. Meets with school board officials who are busy rewriting textbook standards to conform to their own religious agendas. Interviews the people promoting and attending Studyâ courses that turn out to be programs of sectarian indoctrination. In The Good News Club Stewart details how the labor behind the initiatives may be local but the ideas the money and the legal firepower that make them possible are national. The movement is coordinated and given strategic direction by extremely well financed groups whose leaders write the scripts that are followed in classrooms playgrounds and courtrooms from New York to California. Some of the most powerful forces in public education today are groups that most people may never have heard ofâ€”the Alliance Defense Fund the Liberty Counsel the American Center for Law and Justice and other conservative legal groupsâ€”that with combined budgets totaling over $100 million per year have masterminded the religious assault on public education. Today Stewart concludes there is more religious activity in American public schools than there has been for the past 100 years. The Christian Rightâ€TMs strategy to back Americaâ is stealthy calculated extremely well-financed and coming soon to a neighborhood near you. And it has our children our schools and our future in its sights down all of the doors all of the barriers to all of the 65\,000-plus elementary schools in the country and take the gospel to this open mission field now Not later Now!â€â€”Mathew Staver President and Founder of Liberty Counsel at the National Convention of the Child Evangelism Fellowship 2010. Katherine Stewart is a journalist whose work has appeared in Newsweek International Marie Claire The London Times The Village Voice The New York Times Rolling Stone and many other publications. She has published two novels and was the coauthor of Rent by Jonathan Larsen the book about the musical of the same name.

Rick Saccone Township and 36 other legislators the measure insists that teachings inspired concepts of civil government that are contained in our Declaration of Independence and the Constitution of the United States.â. This resolution sends a clear message to residents that the state favors Christianity and it thus violates the spirit of the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. It also runs afoul of Section 3 of the Pennsylvania State Constitution which states preference shall ever be given by law to any religious establishments or modes of worship.â Section 3 makes it crystal clear that Pennsylvaniaâ€TMs early representatives recognized the importance of keeping church and state separated and intended government to remain neutral with respect to religion. This resolution is also alienating and will have the effect of informing non-Christians they are little more than second-class citizens. According to data from 2000 the Penn State Universityâ€TMs Association of Religion Data Archives shows that Pennsylvaniaâ€TMs population was 12\,281\,054. Of these 8\,448\,193 were estimated to belong to sort of organized religionâ with about 422\,000 being non-Christian. This leaves around 4 million residents whose religious affiliations are unknown. A 2011 Gallup Poll found that 7 of Americans claim to be atheist which is similar to other studies. Using 7 as a very conservative approximation means that of the 4 million whose religious affiliations are unknown about 280\,000 can be considered atheist. These data suggest there are over 700\,000 non-Christian and atheist Pennsylvania residents who probably do not agree with H.R. 535. Added to this number would be all the Christians who also do not believe that a majority religion should be forced upon non-Christians. Many Christians solemnly believe that religion is a personal endeavor and religious edicts should not be heralded from our state houses. If church-state separation means anything at all it ought to stand for the proposition that government stays out of religion. Many Americans believe in the Bible but many donâ€TMt. Itâ€TMs not the business of the Pennsylvania House to make overt religious proclamations. Itâ€TMs a shame that the House has turned its back on our admirable tradition of government neutrality with respect to religion and sent a message of intolerance to those who do not share the majority faith.

Click through the link to read the entire letter then contact your own representatives to share your views. To Representative Lawrence Curry Senator Vincent Hughes and Congresswoman Allyson Schwartz. I am deeply concerned about the recent Pennsylvania General Assembly’s passage of House Resolution No. 535 passed unanimously on January 24 2012. House Resolution No. 535 declares the year of 2012 to be the of the Bible in the State of Pennsylvania. This resolution was introduced as and deals with the Separation of Church and State issue. I was flabbergasted it was labeled given the recent events in California Rhode Island and right here in Pennsylvania over the last few months. I view this as a cowardly and possibly illegal way to pass backdoor legislation with the sole purpose of laying the groundwork to make Pennsylvania a State Theocracy for the Christian Religion. More troubling was the lack of one dissenting voice for a resolution that is wrought with errors and violates not only the Pennsylvania State Constitution but the Constitution of United States of America. The state legislature has no right to declare any religious text the of God for Pennsylvanians. This state nor this nation is all Christian. There are other religious and life choices including but not limited to Judaism Islam Mormon Universal Unitarian Scientology Eastern philosophy humanist deist and pagan. All have their own belief systems and moral guidelines. The Gen. Assembly has demonstrated a complete lack of understanding of the principles of the Declaration of Independence and the history of Pennsylvania. via Skeptical Inquiry My Letter to State Representives in Response to PA HR 535 of Sesson 2012.

The Philadelphia Separation of Church and State Meetup Group. the Bucks County Committee of DVAU. Friends. The next meeting of the Bucks County Committee of the Delaware Valley Chapter of Americans United for Separation of Church State will be held Tuesday June 1 7:00 pm at the Doylestown Library located at 150 S. Pine St. Doylestown Pa 18901. We are very fortunate to have Attorney Paul Grosswald speak. Attorney Grosswald was involved in a landmark Supreme Court case involving the reciting of the Pledge of Allegiance in a public school. Mr. Grosswald will discuss the arguments he presented to the Supreme Court. He will also provide an update on new Pledge of Allegiance decisions that have been handed down since 2004. At the conclusiong of his talk he will lead a discussion regarding the best strategy for church/state separationists going forward. Is it wise for Mr. Newdow to continue bringing separation cases which are likely to be lost in front of the current Supreme Court Or would it be better if he waited until the makeup of the Court changes before pursuing a separationist agenda Come join us for an informative and lively discussion. Title One Nation Indivisible. Speaker Paul S. Grosswald graduated magna cum laude from Brooklyn Law School in 2001. He specializes in civil rights and employment discrimination cases. He is admitted in New York and New Jersey and in numerous federal courts including the Supreme Court of the United States. Abstract In 2004 attorney Paul S. Grosswald became involved in one of the most controversial Establishment Clause cases ever to reach the United States Supreme Court. Michael Newdow’s daughter’s school district had a policy requiring the school to lead students in a daily recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance. Newdow sued the school district on the grounds that such a policy violates the Establishment Clause of the United States Constitution because the Pledge contains the phrase God. Newdow prevailed in the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals and the Supreme Court agreed to hear the case. Mr. Grosswald entered the case early in 2004 when he co-authored a Friend of the Court Brief on behalf of a coalition of Buddhist Organizations with a combined membership of over 300\,000 Buddhist Americans. Mr. Grosswald’s brief supported Newdow’s position that the school district’s Pledge policy was unconstitutional. Ultimately the Court ruled against Newdow on procedural grounds without addressing the God issue. Nevertheless three Justices issued concurring opinions which squarely addressed the constitutionality of the school district’s Pledge policy. One of those opinions written by Justice Sandra Day O’Connor cited Mr. Grosswald’s brief. Doylestown PA 18901 USA. Tuesday June 1 at 7:00 PM. Attending 3.

NetworkedBlogs. I wanted to publicly thank the the new Delaware Valley Bucks County Chapter of AU for an incredible program last night. Paul Grosswald Esq. who wrote the amicus brief on the part of the Buddhists explained the nuances lack thereof of the Newdow case. His humor and ability to walk us through the case one step at a time brought home the extent that the 1954 addition of G-d in the pledge violates the First amendment. The purpose of the addition is clear to teach children from a young age that loyalty to country is synonymous with loyalty to G-d.It clearly endorses one religion over another as to a Buddhist every recitation of the pledge violates his duty to speech” and as a public school teacher I can attest that in some classes students are coerced into saying the pledge. What I never fathomed before was how the side could defend G-d in the pledge constitutionally. The answer was clear by the end of the presentation. They don’t. Some of the arguments was that the phrase acknowledged limited government the Declaration is NOT the Constitution \,it Promotes Patriotism commemorates the role of religion in American History will be included in the Texas SS textbooks I’m sure and we need to look at the pledge in its entirety as most of it is not about G-d. None of these reasons really argues why the courts support Congress’s inclusion of G-d in the 1954 revision of the pledge and it is still held Constitutional. In 2008 Sarah Palin was asked you offended by the phrase God in the Pledge of Allegiance Why or why not?. Her reply is disturbing for those of us who believe in teaching history accurately on your life. If it was good enough for the founding fathers its good enough for me and I’ll fight in defense of our Pledge of Allegiance.. Mr Grosswald believes in teaching history accurately and he believes in the Constitution. The Pledge wasn’t written until 1892 and the revision of adding under G-d was not made until 1954. Possibly it is time to revisit the historical precedent of reciting the pledge in its present form. Thank you to Mr. Grosswald for traveling to Doylestown to give a brilliant lecture and thank you to Ed and AU for arranging an enlightening program that was so well delivered. Gloria Andersen.

The Definitions of Fire Glass When standard untreated glass comes into contact with elevated temperatures and the intense pressure due to a fire it will more frequently than not buckle under the extreme pressure and will crack or shatter completely and in some cases explode. If this glass were to be part of a door it could be devastating for the inhabitants of a building as the shattering glass could cause injury to person and property. There's also the extra danger that any crack in the tumbler of a door could cause the door which would be otherwise providing an insulating barrier against flames or smoke to lose its integrity and let damaging fire thru where it'd cause harm or just allow smoke to go through the frame and cause damage to person and property. Specifically Treated Glass For reasons of private and property safety as well as the law which rules public safety and building and business owners as a part of health and safety regulation as well as the Regulatory Reform Safety Order 2006 it's important that any doors can withstand fire. It stands to reason that any glass which is utilized in doors especially those which are labelled and classed as fire doors with glass have received special treatment and are able to bear the effects of a fire however serious it could be. When it is considered that untreated glass can bear temperatures of nearly 200c whilst tempered glass can withstand 500f and fireproof glass is able to put up with temperatures up to 1600f it is no wonder that home and business owners favor safety as well as adhering to their legal necessities when it comes to purchasing fire doors with glass. How is Glass Treated There are a bunch of ways that glass can be dealt with to give it the abilities which would be needed to allow it to stand up to the high temperature and pressure which can often be made by a fire. Given the temperature of a fire can rise significantly inside an exceedingly short period of time it's important that fire doors with glass are able to work immediately and can be certain to function in even the most extreme fire scenarios. The various coatings which are a part of the manufacturing process are being continually developed and tested by experienced and qualified fire engineers in lab conditions which mimic real life fire conditions to make certain that at all times the door and accordingly the glass contained inside fire doors with glass may be able to ensure at least a 30 minute integrity and insulation period of time in the face of fire which would mark them out as an FD30 certified door.

Maybe its not on purpose but it just rubs me the wrong way and Im definitely not a person who sppoks or preaches often or easily. And the things they say sometimes its like really I mean dont change what ur doing on account of rumors but to deliberately fuel them. I miss the way music was positive happy and uplifting.

Agreed This video seems like a real cop out to actually make one that would fit the song a lot more. Plus I was really hoping to see a RECENT cameo of Will Ferrel in this especially after I heard that he expressed interest in being a part of the video. Cole World Reply:February 9th 2012 at 5:45 pm.

Kanye is wearing a kilt from the givenchy MEN’s couture spring 2011 collection FYI. Just Felt Like Buggin Reply:February 9th 2012 at 8:03 pm. Just cause its expensive and name brand doesnt mean you have to put it on. Would it look sweet if you knew it came from Wal-Mart. Cole World Reply:February 9th 2012 at 8:46 pm. Did I say he had to wear it because it was name brand No. Im clarifying that it’s men’s fashion its not like he took it from a womens line.

I wouldn’t do Wikipedia to save my life. Read books scholared based articles matter of fact go to a historic Library. The individuals who post videos on youtube have researched and basically imaging what they researched again please research for yourself so you will fully understand and not what someone else tells you. Again knowledge is power. That’s one of the main problems in our generation we don’t like to read but agree with what anybody tells them. RESEARCH!!. miznae757 Reply:February 9th 2012 at 6:28 pm. explain to me what the Illuminati actually is and not some shit you seen in a youtube video. Lorena Lovelace Reply:February 9th 2012 at 6:45 pm. I don’t rely on others for knowledge. Everyone should do thier OWN research and not depend on other like Knowledge is power. Which includes I never explain anything I learned and researched myself and YOU should too Have a nice day Kayy_J Reply:February 9th 2012 at 7:31 pm.

I agree man don’t sweat about the people who don’t agree because at the end of the day they are still going to be nut riders off these rappers. I am a fan and don’t know much about illuminati symbolism but this video and past videos of them have made me start to think. I digg you LoveLace researching yourself is the only way to understand and not just giving people one sentence of Illuminati its much more I believe. LeFleur Reply:February 9th 2012 at 11:19 pm.

Call people nuts politically correct conspiracists because they question things the avg. person doesn’t bother to do. Anyone care to wonder why the song was played 8x The darkness and references to illuminati cults and symbolisms the secrecy the overall changes in Hip Hop I adore Kanyeee but he’s acting completely different. And before this even became a thing associated with the music industry I remember watching about the Freemasonary on History channel about 10 years ago. This shit is deep many are scared of the truth. Val. February 10 2012 at 1:55 am. Ugh I know y’all was going to bring up that illuminati shit. Drives me nuts. It’s like every black person with money is an illuminati. Do you know how rock bands that go wayyyy darker and deeper in their songs. Get over it. People will believe anything negative. Miss Moore. February 10 2012 at 2:26 am. Wow I feel like this really didn’t have to be a video. I really don’t like the song to begin with like y we gotta be niggas in Paris?. But I did enjoy Ye dancing in that leather kilt he is sooo extra and I love it. va. February 10 2012 at 4:52 am. Man I have to say this is truly Illuminati inspired music It is filled with the symbols and devil worship Not cool at all I really dislike music that is there just to coruppt the masses with crap like this Sorry to say but this is not talent .. It’s all just negative and will never be cool It seems like in our culture and media what is bad is cool but if people open their minds to these subliminal messeges in the music they listen to then finally people will start to wake up and smell the coffee .. va Reply:February 10th 2012 at 6:50 am. Even if you don’t believe that the Illuminati exists to make it clear and simple just look at the video and you will see something is not right in this video as well as many others out there It doesn’t have to be hip hop or rap it can be any kind of music Look at Lady Gaga her videos are also filled with satanic symbolism jealous ones still envy. February 10 2012 at 11:17 am. that ish cray!!. TRUTH. February 10 2012 at 11:34 am. This video is demonic and full of mind control Subliminal messages with frequency waves thru TV..and if you dont understand that then they have accomplished just what they set out to do..and you are a slave Everything thing in hollywood has a motive and a meaning behind it..My head is hurting and that is not normal for a music video..My saying this im not downplaying that Kanye is not talented nor Jay-z but this is not college dropout kanye..just sayin. yeah i said it.

Tupac said it best when he coined the phrase Which means you dumb conspiracy theorists need to kill the illuminatti talk as he put it. Go educate yourselves on reality and real history. While your educating yourselves on history educate yourselves on free market and austrian economics vs. keynisian economics and try to become capitalists instead of as you claim that you are. QUEEN B Reply:February 10th 2012 at 4:25 pm. he meant killuminatti which means to END it Pac was against the illuminati he wasnt a devil worshiper He was good and he didnt sell his soul to the devil. circa-81 is Anti-Ghetto Reply:February 10th 2012 at 4:51 pm. Are you crazy. Tupac said Killuminatti because he was trying to put an end to ni99@s wasting their time on something as fiction as conspiracy theory. He wasn’t against the illuminati because he didn’t believe in the illuminati. He was against a bunch of ni99@s wasting their time on fantasy. You people have it twisted. say killuminatti because how can a ni99 sitting in a jail cell in prison think he have the key to it all?. Tupac. Your obviously young and misguided so why don’t you do what you’ve obviously have been doing too much of and find the killuminati clip on youtube. Why don’t all of you retards who believe in the illuminati go and look up what tupac actually thought of the you dumb@$$es that believe in the illuminati. HE MADE UP THE WORD TO DESCRIBE YOU DUMB@$$ES. I swear youngin’s. NICKI GARBAJ.

Clive Davis on celebrating Monica Brandy return to the stage We never really had the opportunity 14 years ago to celebrate Boy Is Mineâ€TM the way that we should It became a really old-time best selling single and they only performed it once before on MTV. So the opportunity at this Pre-Grammy Glala the night before the Grammys that stands for the best in music really has performers pairing together like youâ€TMve never seen before. Really very few people have seen Monica and Brandy sing Boy Is Mine.â€TM It was wonderful when I got word of all this my first thought was lets celebrate. Brandy reuniting with Monica Timing is everything so I think this was the time we had a great song and we both love the song we loved the subject matter and we just went from there. It just feels like old friendsâ€TM magic happening all over again in 2012. Monica on Whitney Houston showing support during rehearsal When so many things were happening in my life that werenâ€TMt in favor of me reaching my full potential she was always there pushing me and I think that it made it feel good when she was in the audience just reminding us helping us with sound and doing different things today because their expertise hers or Mr. Davis it canâ€TMt be found anywhere else.

U always ask for things but when they get them they aren’t satisfied I’m glad they didn’t try to remake the boy is mine. They did a young fresh song. I LOVE Monica’s hair and hair color. She can wear long or short. And this is huge. The pre Grammy part is THE place to be and perform. Shawn Reply:February 10th 2012 at 2:43 pm. I know right It’s like Clive Davis pre Grammy party is damn near bigger than the Grammy’s. LOL. Erika Reply:February 10th 2012 at 3:10 pm. Its MUCH bigger than the Grammys. Many people dont go to the Grammys anymore unless they are nominated or performing. kaybee Reply:February 10th 2012 at 12:43 pm. Brandyyy...its her year..I love me some Monica..but long hair NO.

Tina Reply:February 10th 2012 at 12:29 pm. Yeah I have noticed Monica’s recent thickness lately as well. She has been on preggo watch for me anyway. Whether she is or is not at the moment..the extra weight looks good on her. Erika Reply:February 10th 2012 at 3:10 pm. Yall arent the only ones who noticed. lol. My friends saw her at the other week in Atlanta and asked if she was pregnant. Caramel25. February 10 2012 at 12:03 pm. I love Monica and Brandy and I’m glad they’re back making great music. I would really love if they could record a full album together. bye girl. February 10 2012 at 12:04 pm. love these two ladies boy is mine is a classic. unfortunately in my opinion their new song isn’t as rememberable or catchy. i guess lightening doesn’t always strike twice. nonetheless i’m happy to see that both of these ladies have grown in the industry and i look forward to seeing them preform Queen of Music. February 10 2012 at 12:05 pm. Why pregrammy and not grammy?. I must add I was just disappointed with this new song. I really had to think of who was singing what in the song. It was just too mad for a boy is mine follow up but I wish them luck. Kara Reply:February 10th 2012 at 12:27 pm. Actually Clive’s pregrammy party is more exclusive/harder to get into than the Grammys. And they arent performing at the Grammys to be honest because neither is nominated etc. This song just came out Monday. And I have to add...I am slightly disappointed with the new song as well. DontVoteDontComplain Reply:February 10th 2012 at 1:05 pm. Agreed. If given the chance I’d much rather attend Clive’s pre-Grammy party over the actual Grammys. DOLL11-ONE. February 10 2012 at 12:06 pm. Hope their performance is great .......beautiful voices..................... sidenote I think both look better with shorter hair...esp Ms Monica. YoursTruly. February 10 2012 at 12:14 pm. So they REALLY gone force this crappy single down our throats huh?. They better be performing the The Boy Is Mineâ€¦Mo got a album coming out the 1st week in March and THIS is what she gone lead out with??. Who in the HECK is doing the thinking over there at Arista Records!. Are they not reading the blogs twitter or FB the fans clearly said NO to this single for godâ€TMs sake I wouldnâ€TMt be SO irritated over this song if I didnâ€TMt KNOW they BOTH are capable of a better effort!!!. MISHKA Reply:February 10th 2012 at 12:27 pm. Clive Davis founded Arista part of RCA. Kris Reply:February 10th 2012 at 12:35 pm. Monica’s album is being released on April 10th. But I get what you are saying. Outside of stans some of them as well most people are not really feeling the song. Vocally those girls can sang but I think they got cheated with the juvenille lyrics and production. YoursTruly Reply:February 10th 2012 at 12:40 pm. Ok I didn’t know her album was pushed to April\,thank goodness b/c if this song was best representation of it I’m scared. I think they should have worked with Brian Michael Cox his sound and lyrical arrangements fits their maturity level so much better than some Rico Love. Lola AâTM Reply:February 10th 2012 at 2:03 pm. If I could give this a thousand thumbs up I would. Lovely1. February 10 2012 at 12:18 pm. Beautiful Ladies .....love them and their voices.....much Love. Ne Ne aka iB@S. February 10 2012 at 12:24 pm. NB thanxx for changing that american apparel ad of the girl in the green pants...anywho i see another ad giving us a backshot...but i’ll let it slide...it looks fake tho.. Tina. February 10 2012 at 12:30 pm. The new song is not what’s up. I LOVE them both...but the lyrics could have been much better. Who produced it. DontVoteDontComplain Reply:February 10th 2012 at 1:39 pm. Rico Love the new hot go to producer. Randy. February 10 2012 at 12:33 pm. Monica is a bad chick I want my wife to look just like her. ShayShay. February 10 2012 at 12:45 pm. UMM SPEAK FOR YOUSELF. BECAUSE YOU SOUND NUTS. 1ST OF ALL ITS EVIDENT YOU ARENT UP 2 DATE BECAUSE THEY ARE BOTH SIGNED TO RCA RECORDS SAME LABEL) THERE IS NO ARISTA RECORDS ANY LONGER.. THE FANS DID NOT SAY NO TO THIS THEY DID THE SONG BECAUSE FANS BEEN REQESUTING ANOTHER DUET YEARS. OF COURSE THE NEW SONG WILL NEVER REACH THE HEIGHTS OF BOY IS MINE” HOWEVER THESE TWO LADIES ARE THE BEST IN R&B WITH THAT SAID PEOPLE WHO ARE SUPPORTING THIS KNOW DAMN WELL THIS SHIT IS GOOD. MAYBE NOT FOR YOU BECAUSE OF YOUR EXPECTATIONS WERE SET ELSEWHERE. BUT MONICA BRANDY ARE R&B QUEENS THEY CAN’T LOSE WITH THIS 1. SO WHY ARE YOU SOOOO O_o EW. YOU DONT KNOW WHATS BEST FOR THESE WOMAN CAUSE YOU DON’T EVEN MAKE SENSE.. ShayShay. February 10 2012 at 12:47 pm. I WONDER WHY PPL ARE SO STUCK ON THE CONTENT OF LYRICS I DONT SEE ANYTHING WRONG WITH THEM THESE ARE TWO YOUNG WOMAN. SO WHAT THEY MENTION FACEBOOK MACBOOK IN THE SONG. ISNT THAT CURRENT THOUGH PPL BE BUGGIN K. February 10 2012 at 12:49 pm. I was speaking about their new song the other day and someone brought up how similar the song is to Beyonce I had to take a listen again and it is quite similar which makes we wonder if the song came out by someone else would the opinion be different. The song is actually growing on me but it took at least 12 listens. Boy is Mine set a high standard that I dont know if any follow up would match. -1 aisha. February 10 2012 at 12:49 pm. Monica looks like she’s eaten something sour in that first pic. Randy Reply:February 10th 2012 at 12:56 pm. lmao. DontVoteDontComplain. February 10 2012 at 1:00 pm. Both these ladies have put out better sounding material than their recent duet but it wasn’t supported. Now they are taking the route of many other urban artists by recording music that will appeal to the pop audience. If you don’t support your favorite artists when they put out quality music don’t be surprised when they start putting out music that will appeal to other audiences. Mark my words this song will be at the top of the pop charts in no time. LALA Reply:February 10th 2012 at 1:19 pm. Picking Rico was a hit or miss to be honest. But to the poster who said singers going to pop more...unfortunately that is SO true. Moreover labels only tend to support singers who do that. RCA hasnt show any interest in Monica’s project and promotion until now and THIS song is def more pop than r&b. I wish them both much success on both of their albums and marriage/relationships. Say word. February 10 2012 at 1:13 pm. Love em both!. I wish them nothing but success on their up and coming ventures. shwaggg. February 10 2012 at 1:42 pm. brandy is looking all types of FAB that outfit plus those louboutins. -4 The Public. February 10 2012 at 2:04 pm.

Good for you guys Successful Black Talented and Beautiful Women...I don’t care if they aren’t hot like Rhianna and Beyonce or Adele...They still have a place in Music No Shade...congrats ladies. Roe. February 10 2012 at 2:09 pm. LOL..Whitney looks like some random crackhead running around there. Tyga_Fan Reply:February 10th 2012 at 5:15 pm. LOL!. You’re right. Such a shame to see someone so talented end up this way. I hope she recovers soon. aries. February 10 2012 at 2:12 pm. i love that they got together again. bring that 90′s music back please. brandy looks really cute. SWEETRED. February 10 2012 at 2:31 pm. Congratulations to them both I wish them much success with the new song. I hope to finally see Monica wear something beautiful at this show. branstarnmodove. February 10 2012 at 2:31 pm. I’m sooo excited I just can’t wait for everything that they are gonna do I’m gonna buy both of the albums and I have to say that i really thought Rico was gonna give them something smooth like Wrong or goes my Baby but this song is growing on me a whole lot.
