We new dog that’s still bit puppy likes drag things dog door backyard. She doesn’t typically chew shoes takes outside deposits fort back door. One day wife I talking I driving home work said look back yard get home. Naturally I curious I restricted like replied with looks like diaper bomb went there. Apparently Maggie found trash bedroom putting diapers taking outside one one. Now might wondering I’m telling relates point. You really need less like son watching movie constantly asking what’s going happen patient. I’m 250 words this. When stuff strewn back yard I hate going there. It’s surrounded fence nobody sees removes motivation I might clean up. I don’t even like mowing there. Normally nobody knows except family it’s big deal. However last week anyone driving house knew lack back yard cleanliness. After couple days strong winds one good storm already pathetic fence gave one side house came crashing down. I look outside storm notice three fence panels ground two waving like fans football game realized camera turned direction.

Just like fence sometimes guard people see bit I’m really like. I might try quickly build fence back someone sees back yard personality probably won’t forget it especially contradicts I normally do. My point behind need sure display front yard lives public face consistent live back yard life. We expect privacy there also understand moment privacy broken things try hide public view displayed see. Luke 12:2-3 tells us. 2 For nothing covered revealed hidden known. 3 Therefore whatever spoken dark heard light spoken ear inner rooms proclaimed housetops. Let us live lives proclaimed housetops love Savior dedication living lives calling He given us. We light world shining like city hill make known His sacrifice us glory His.

Temptation way dragging back onto wide path you’ve trying walk straight narrow. Sometimes though make choices yourself. You see someone else letting slide think wrong begin think it’s OK too. It could swearing movies drinking anything. You start feel pressure you’re one different everyone else begin conform ways around you. And conformed world transformed renewing mind may prove good acceptable perfect God. Romans 12:2 The little things add up time. First decide tell little white lie don’t get trouble. You follow lies cover original lie. Years later you’re telling spouse you’ve office day really you’ve bar it’s become natural lie tell truth. Opening door sin allows sin get foothold life. We’ve got battle back sin Holy Spirit actively engaging fight passively allowing enemy roll us. This something doesn’t come natural us really struggle do. However reward fighting back sin lives eternal. Imagine worker notices problem dam holding back millions gallons water. Below dam quaint little town full people going everyday lives. If worker notices small leak dam fix leak say it’s small leak fine. Those millions gallons water placing pressure small leak causing grow little bigger passing day. Gradually leak turns gaping hole allowing water pass through causing minor issues little town. Still worker says dam still standing hole isn’t causing much damage. I’ll ignore it.. Eventually gaping hole gives way actual dam break. Millions gallons water rushing hill towards little town destroying everything path. The little town destroyed people injured killed dam worker justifies saying dam broke!. Now let’s talk sin way. Maybe you’ve allowed little sin life don’t want deal it’s big deal. Everyone small issues right Your family doesn’t know everything looks normal. However sin placing pressure rest life wanting allow sin come through. Gradually sin grows something family notice don’t really identify cause problem. You continue justify saying everyone it it’ll OK. It’s causing many problems life let continue. Finally dam breaks. You act sin big way destroying family reputation relationship God. You might say don’t know happened I wasn’t myself happened!. This happens allow sin erode life. Our familiarity sin unacceptable God. We cannot friendly sin friendly God time. Through prayer devotion Him God give us ability overcome sin make effort so. We pursue God He renew minds.

What’s Your Type The 5-Step Guide Finding Right Font. 4 Unique Ways Increase Email Marketing Conversion Rates. Engaging voters online increasingly important part electoral process. The 2008 Presidential campaign saw Barack Obama Democratic Party rightly complimented effective use web technology social media. As Republican presidential primary campaign continues GOP learned lessons How four remaining candidates portraying online. Romney makes big mistake immediately hiding main website behind mundane splash page. The splash page intended encourage people sign updates campaign need candidate develop strong list important. But call action could easily incorporated main site right first experience anyone visiting Romney’s campaign site mediocre unattractive extra-step. I’m sure it’s going put lot visitors. Once get past splash page Romney pretty appealing site. The layout strong makes really effective use imagery. Good use white space gives clean professional look. It’s easy find Romney stance issues well latest campaign news. It’s also site provides really visible links state specific information 50 states. I like clear calls action main social media services. Facebook Twitter Google options share major stories seamlessly integrated separate options engaging candidate directly social media. This suggests clear understanding there’s distinction building social media followers sharing content. GRADE B. Gingrich’s site scores highly usability doesn’t really strong visual impact. It’s well put together traditional layout appearance. Kind like standard blog template means looks dated. Navigation simple clear calls action anyone interested getting involved campaign donating buying campaign related merchandise. Social media seems much afterthought given Gingrich massive Twitter following compared candidates). It also looks like areas site aren’t updated often enough. As I write this still sections helping Gingrich win Iowa caucus New Hampshire primary events happened couple weeks ago. GRADE C. Ron Paul’s candidate using WordPress campaign website candidates use Drupal. Initial engagement strong. I really like donation thermometer real time count donor helps suggest Paul campaign engages individual people. It makes powerful call action donations. I confused navigating around site. The two columns articles front page opinion-based Ticker’ Paul News’ aren’t well differentiated. The navigation bar many options different sections site could clearly defined. Social media integration relatively low key site generally others indeed Paul candidate. I think would benefit larger font size it’s fallen pixel trap might look OK first glance isn’t well suited easily browsing text. GRADE B. I don’t like website. The layout odd looks strange larger windows it’s like they’ve tried create fluid width layout without really understanding principle. It’s blocky little ugly bad typography. Add lack clear call action I’m unsure site trying achieve. Even language little unusual sections written third person sections written first person. It gives feeling committee website doesn’t strong creative vision sense purpose. Of primary candidate websites Santorum’s one looks amateurish. The first time took moments work navigation was site layout works way completely draw eye away menu. GRADE D. It’s clear leading GOP candidates upped game understand importance good website candidates John Huntsman Rick Perry Herman Cain Michelle Bachmann also reasonably polished sites. There’s still lot room improve. None sites use HTML 5 technology SEO basic none design particularly outstanding. The GOP candidates may taken steps improve online presence long way go. About Author.

Fucked Up's lead bellower Damian Abraham gets words himself although he's also got support former Del-Byzanteens singer/keyboardist Jim Jarmusch- yes fine he's director too- intones verses either Annie-Claude DeschÃanes Duchess Says Katie Stelmanis Austra add pretty hey-I-can-actually-sing vocals FU using contrast Abraham's voice past years. The marvelous thing Tiger actually fully constructed song vamp-with-solos chain vaguely related pieces segued together builds builds builds one new riff another uncoiling wrapping around pillar others. It's bombastic hell course- keyboard part closest Fucked Up ever come Meat Loaf- product band thinks big. The song's weak point lyrics lots sharply observed images castle gristle bone\") also many passages dodgy overwrought diction deathly coddle light\". Abraham's guttural howl great equalizer lyrics sung sections reveal words awkwardness Lines as drips like paint heaven A shining pall horizon\, easier get away screamed chirped. Fucked Up's blog describes second side Year Tiger weird rager\, right. It appears full-on 22-minute instrumental palindrome pyramidal stack drones riffs crashing forward-and-backward beat- closest thing they've ever produced Melvins extreme recordings HÃ1⁄4sker DÃ1⁄4's Reoccurring. For experiment\, exceptionally listenable Again band great arrangements every five-second segment record sounds almost quite like one next it. If movie soundtrack it'd sequence violently strobing red light. It's much much much- exactly rely Fucked Up for is. Who would ask anything less

The security devices used UK banks appear tokens generate dynamic one-time passcode Bank customers log onto bank sites OTP instead using regular static password. OTP strong authentication effective validating identity customer logging onto online banking site. But isnâ€TMt enough validate transactions customer may carry logging in. The financial fraud described article result Man-in-the-Browser attacks caused malware infected userâ€TMs computer. The malware kicks customer already logged site. It hijacks online transaction siphons money criminal accounts. The attacks show strong authentication cannot protect online banking customers fraud resulting man browser attacks. Nevertheless ways prevent type attack successful. The first customer validate every transaction. This achieved customer signs transaction electronic signature. Another way preventing attack bank online trusted browser. The trusted browser stored disk-on-key. When customer wants bank online connect flash drive computer trusted browser loads. Since trusted browser stored secure environment susceptible malware way regular browser is. SafeNet saying quite time strong authentication enough protect online transactions.

For simple example timed Christmas lights present significant surges demand come near time set time. Without kind coordination smart grid provide increased use devices lead electric service reliability problems power quality disturbances blackouts brownouts. With evolution utility consumption production energy companies needed better way monitor supply manage utility systems. First developed Automatic Meter Reading 1980s following decade developed Advanced Metering Infrastructure Security security) able store electricity used various times day. This information invaluable last 15 years brought even challenges demand utility providers requiring add even advanced monitoring communication system. This called Smart Grid. Smart grids work AMI create network links customers utility companies provides increased insight management energy consumption cost workload across entire energy grid. But energy utilities play vital part everyday lives smart grid technologies introduce new smart grid security issues challenges must addressed. Implementing smart grid without proper smart grid protection could result grid instability loss private information utility fraud unauthorized access energy consumption data.

By tracking displacement levitating gold particle trapped focused laser beam team recorded acoustic vibrations nearby nanoparticles. The researchers also able determine direction sound came. The researchers estimate nano-ear detect sound levels low -60 decibels making device million times sensitive human hearing. The Courtesy American Physical Society. WHAT’S NEW Optical tweezersâ€”infrared lasers focused optical microscope trap tiny objectsâ€”are standard tool used study cells metal particles DNA more. Researchers move laser beam pick manipulate objects studying motion. But LMU Munich team put technique different use. wondering happens something disturbs motion instance sound wave\,â said first author Alexander Ohlinger. itâ€TMs possible detect disturbance could use optical tweezers microphone.â. Ohlinger colleagues tested theory two experiments. First recorded trapped particleâ€TMs response relatively strong sound sourceâ€”a needle vibrating loudspeaker. Next detected significantly weaker acoustics patch vibrating gold nanoparticles heated laser image above. In instances acoustic waves detected accurately. IMPORTANCE The nano-ear could open whole new field microscopy\,â said Ohlinger. Using optical tweezers scientists might able listen bacteria viruses even cellular processes like DNA replication mitosis. The technique highly accessible tools usedâ€”lasers nanoparticles dark-field microscope ordinary video camera record movementâ€”can readily acquired lab Ohlinger added.

Where films progress linear fashion Morisset takes things step further maybe sideways. Through simple interactions like scrolling mouse across computer screen complicated ones like dancing front webcam Morisset’s films ask audience participate unfolding narrative. His approach tailor-made web 2.0. Just Facebook Twitter worthwhile users get involved Morisset’s work truly comes alive audience input. Readers may know Morisset’s work involvement Grammy-winning band Arcade Fire worked since 2004 breakout album Funeral. Since then he’s created music videos interactive web content 2009 documentary Mirroir Noir alongside band. Most recently directed beautifully unsettling video Sprawl II Beyond Mountains)\, Arcade Fire’s latest single. The video presents characters whose behaviors mimic viewer. Dance quickly music characters same slow they’ll follow suit. If stop dancing altogether characters stop progressing movements stuck endless loop. Morisset also worked Icelandic post-rockers Sigur Ros directing band’s concert film Inni may traditional film though methods creation anything but. He shot edited movie digital HD transferred black-and-white film projecting onto screen recording projection 16mm cameras. The 16mm version movie projected Morisset collaborators improvised manipulations using found objects. Then filmed edited version using digital HD equipment. The result uncanny promotional materials accurately describe near-monochromatic tunnel visionâ€¦[inviting intimacy claustrophobia. We recently spoke Morisset ideas behind work collaborating musicians complicated relationship technology. interview edited length clarity.. Andy Cush Evolver.fm I wanted start asking background especially interactive side art. How come work particular format. Vincent Morisset Director When I younger I wanted go cinema I went school direction. When I university I communication program. You decide whether go TV cinema radio. The year I choose profile opened new program called multimedia fit personality. I’m guy touch every aspect it I jumped program. This late path kind changed point. For couple years I’d mainly developing graphic-based websites time limitation medium. In beginning bandwidth allowed us play video point two loves I may say joined back together. I started video-based projects. I part team people I guy comfortable technology. I don’t consider geek. I don’t love programming I learned code Lingo ActionScript make projects happen. So I kind self-taught programming background time I studied cinema. At point two backgrounds collided I started call interactive video. Evolver.fm Do see technology worth pursuing it’s making something high-tech tools available Or means achieve artistic vision. Morisset I’m geek. I’m really excited technology sake. I think offers amazing possibilities I’m one guys get excited it. Ideas always drive projects I use tools around achieve them. I think it’s important understand possibilities limitations tools me it’s important projects driven ideas don’t become technology demos whatever. Evolver.fm A lot work though technologically impressive manages feel handmade human animations interactive film Bla Bla instance homespun quality newest Arcade Fire video II\"]. Morisset Thanks. I think there’s paradox relationship technology. In way I love it. One mottos web fun. I love platform I love medium way connect images laptop really different way relate images TV screen. Since I want trigger emotions projects I work hard kind forget we’re front computer. We forget technology feels like kind weird magical thing reacting do. Evolver.fm Would talk little bit II video processes behind it came be. Morisset I’ve working band forever back since Funeral ongoing creative collaboration going on. When recording The Suburbs\,Â I working artistic director whole visual aspect artwork juggling different ideas various projects. For while I wanted develop interactive video project would free interface thing that’s really spontaneous primitive. I showed really basic little demo Regine Arcade Fire's singer/multi-instrumentalist] waved hand webcam triggered sounds flickered screen. She said thought they’d song little pop kind song could dance to she’d play done. At end ended Sprawl II. It kind disco-ish me fit perfectly concept. So time passed I worked projects end album cycle I like really this.. The band totally dance-activated video wanted make sure people without webcam good computer would still able sense world creating decided kind hybrid project. We would traditional film could seen YouTube TV parallel would interactive video. That kind challenge shoot I two parallel projects two totally different mediums. Evolver.fm Thematically album seems conflicted state modern life know it video dovetails nicely that. You created images that times almost feel like home video presented new confusing context. A still Morisset's interactive video Sprawl II. Morisset We wanted something would really simple straightforward boring. So asked like music videos decided make something felt spontaneous fun bit strangeness added. It’s always funny I first show project different kinds people. When start understand cause effect gestures echo choreography there’s moment they’re like They get bit freaked out. And pass moment kind assimilate make video own. It’s funny different people interact depending personality cultural background. Some people analytical it people let loose. It’s funny see people connect piece like that. Evolver.fm The interactivity makes much whatever baggage you’re bringing table spectator artist put it. Morisset It also connects song about. There’s character alienated environment wants get loose escape alienating environment. The fact dance front computer also bit liberating kind weird you’re context normally dance. You’re work computer living room there’s moment cross tiny boundary. Evolver.fm One criticisms often hear internet culture causes people short attention spans media consume. Because interactive work mostly experienced online nature\,Â there’s good chance people won’t give full attention others perceive frivolous. Does bother all. Morisset No all. I like gray area music video culture. There’s something really exciting niche you’re juggling two worlds. You connect broad audience you’re able propose things unusual sometimes bit challenging. It’s okay people see one way another. It’s part process part game. I quite like fact able reach kinds people present different contexts. At point don’t control contexts piece re-presented in don’t know people look it. And I think that’s kind cool. Evolver.fm Yeah must pretty exciting. Just releasing wild. Morisset You need embrace that. It’s part web is. Evolver.fm There seems connection music lot work even stuff isn’t commissioned band. When began career artist know you’d close relationship music Or something evolved own. Morisset Your life accidents happy accidents. The fact I started work Arcade Fire something like eight years ago led projects bounced projects projects people asking work them. In last years I’ve lucky enough work amazing artists. I would say it’s kind theory encounters. I didn’t look music-related projects kind happened like that. And I must say I decided next year I’d like explore things.Â But I love music I think there’s strong connection music image especially interactive stuff. When you’re playing non-linear editing music gives thing kind emotional spine. It gives structure. Even you’re playing something that’s really reactive least backbone keep tension dramatic crescendos piece. So it’s something really useful artist working interactive material I don’t way pigeonholed music stuff. Like I said before I like touch kinds things. Evolver.fm Something attracted Inni hands-on analog manipulation film guys doing. You’re taking something originally filmed digitally HD working it like would clay paint physical artistic object. Could explain process. Morisset I see traditional film. It’s linear hour long I took lot expertise I developed web projects process. I’m always trying destroy slick perfect bit soulless look computer-ish imagery. In Bla Bla same. I old school stop motion puppet rotoscoped face 3D I could map mouth eyes real time. So I working something really fragile imperfect using sophisticated technology along it. With Inni it’s kind way around. We took advantage really light-sensitive cameras able edit film straightforward efficient way. But too-crisp feel almost like watching news TV. It kind killed magic aura Sigur Ros is. So I thought we’d try spontaneous approach post-production. When I pitched idea Sigur Ros I comparing Neil Young Dead Man soundtrack. He sat front Jim Jarmusch film guitar looking first time jammed it. There’s really volatile imperfect thing makes alive beautiful. Again computers amazing things there’s something organic handmade stuff. You can’t fake it. You need put hands dirt it. Evolver.fm Tell synchronized artwork The Suburbs. Morisset Well I think there’s lot potential really straightforward way presenting digital content synchronized song. It struck people haven’t embraced path. I like I thought cool idea. Why aren’t people it It’s kind no-brainer. It makes sense 2012 we’re still stuck JPEG whole album. It’s bizarre. It’s blocked Apple way. It couldn’t sold store it’s standard MP3s it’s exactly app either. Evolver.fm It reminds little bit BjÃ¶rk’s Biophilia suite apps. Obviously they’re different seem piece way looking album format asking could differently 2012?. Morisset With BjÃ¶rk thing need get app listen song. You’re kind forced involved it. For me listening music something go ways. I remember sitting couch I younger opening vinyl sleeve reading lyrics. But I’m bus I don’t want hold record sleeve. I want put sleep put pocket still able listen it. I still want put random songs I still want able put tracks playlist. The BjÃ¶rk thing cool itself I would love could embedded listening environment. If you’re that can’t anything else. If listen app album you’re that virtual booklet open times. Evolver.fm Have seen interactive work bands people inspires you. Morisset It’s interactive I likeÂ Radio Soulwax. It’s set mixtapes evolving artwork. Evolver.fm Is anything happening world mainstream narrative film that’s got excited Is world would ever consider trying work in. Morisset I’m embracing traditional linear films. I’ve done two films it’s world I’m totally unfamiliar with.Â One thing I think exciting films get around now. I think we’re verge changing distribution consume films films bit niche able reach audience easily. I think Mirroir Noir Arcade Fire documentary one first feature films originally distributed online. When first came out way could see buy online download HD video.Â It bit peculiar film festivals theater screenings. At end I think successful able reach single day whole fan community. And people wanted see film. I think gone traditional path people would found torrent wanted pirate wanted see badly. So way short-circuited threat way good. After that film got screened theaters film events. So film’s life inverted good way.

Ek give keynote address GRAMMY Foundationâ€TMs Entertainment Law Initiative Luncheon Scholarship Presentation Feb. 10 Beverly Hills Calif. For information GRAMMY Foundation visit www.grammyfoundation.org. The 54th Annual GRAMMY Awards airs live Sunday Feb. 12 CBS. Eliot Van Buskirk Evolver.fm It’s year since last met. How things going lately. Daniel Ek CEO Spotify I’ve got bit sore throat right now you’re asking personally Spotify fantastic. That’s always great. Evolver.fm Can give us preview intend discuss GRAMMY Foundation’s Entertainment Law Initiative Luncheon. Ek There’s lot interesting debate going streaming I like it’s become streaming what’s free not. But I really want talk future. We debate right now I still think streaming really infancy I want outline future looks like actually mean music industry. What would mean promote act Or revenues. We’re time people saying actually working\, we’ve got two-and-a-half million paying customers number growing very quickly keeps accelerating. Personally speaking I bullish future music industry ever before I think we’re kind entering golden age music. Evolver.fm:Â What golden age look like. Spotify gets political Barack Obama's reelection campaigners posted Spotify playlist featuring favorite songs including president's. Ek:Â First I think we’re talking world where I believe access. There ownership well. I think total amount revenues back industry going grow. We’ve paid $200 million rightsholders already it’s still early days. So me part talking growth story get music industry back used be probably even past that. The second part is world music really listening music friends discovering you mean break acts promote acts Spotify now hasn’t really done great job helping that you’re going see us break acts try really promote well. Looking Spotify today fast-forwarding three years 2015 Where’s music industry Where’s Spotify mean band manager label I think it’s exciting times. Creating record really three core components. The first thing creating actual record. It used really expensive now really anyone record record even homes. The second piece used really expensive distributing record iTunes Spotify services distributing another digital copy basically doesn’t cost anything. But funny thing is marketing used kind simple old days. You used able put radio MTV worked. If good song record started selling based that. Today media landscape much fragmented. MTV’s music anymore radio even hard[er break through. There tons radio channels play stuff people already know. So marketing act today really really really expensive. If went broadcast medium getting everyone social medium music discovered friends mean marketing music I think that’s core component getting work. Evolver.fm:Â That’s really good point. I guess we’re also seeing audio ads within Spotify clips songs. Ek:Â Hopefully I’ll also able go interesting things we’ve seen address] especially Facebook acts like Foster The People kind blew service really friends started discovering people. That’s great story us show works. People discovered radio didn’t much promotion friends kept recommending listening it friends turn discovered it.. Evolver.fm:Â Is part decision require Facebook login Spotify see social sharing important. Ek We look sharing music really really important business. We’ve found social users i.e. they’re sharing music faster grow music library. faster grow music library faster become paying customers. That’s really rationale us really marketing side feel combination Spotify positive thing. Evolver.fm:Â I remember first met New York years ago said wanted create legal version sort experience people P2P version. My favorite thing Napster searching one rare band I loved. If someone that I trusted them knew I going like anything else had. Ek:Â Yep. Evolver.fm:Â It seems like succeeded translating legal music service congratulations that. Ek:Â Yes we’ve done that. Right now it’s skewed toward friends. What want make skew toward discovering people great music taste well. Evolver.fm:Â Are misunderstandings Spotify you’d like clear up. Ek:Â I feel extent we’re victim success. What I mean is especially look media Spotify seen gigantic company size iTunes really true. We’re really starting here that’s feel it. If look country like U.S. there’s sub-1 percent population that’s even using legal streaming service. I think sometimes people perceive us lot larger are that’s important point make. Spotify CEO Daniel Ek unveils company's app strategy New York event Eliot Van Buskirk). point I want make very different model selling record. Everyone talks volume means terms numbers I don’t think it’s comparable. In world today 500 million people listening music online. Out them there’s small portion avid iTunes customers look today majority digital music ecosystem. So way we’re approaching is want reach 500 million people vast majority aren’t really using iTunes. I’d also like address people think they’ll gain sales Spotify. There’s shred data suggest that. In fact information available points streaming services helping drive sales. Album unit sales U.S. 2011 year Spotify launched first time since 2004. More dozen albums debuted number one available Spotify launch. Spotify users exact people used listen music every day YouTube whose entire music collection pulled BitTorrent sites. By offering compelling music service allows discover hundreds new artists favorites pulled YouTube we’re seeing millions move back listening music legally years left cold. They’re helping pay ton money back industry. You’re talking 10 million active users 2.5 million subscribers paying $120 year double amount average iTunes user. Do really want hold back album people finally paying music again If think you’re getting buy album CD album download again there’s absolutely evidence back theory up. Your album’s getting shared en masse BitTorrent YouTube. It’s there right decide it’s paying loyal music fans lose out. It makes sense. Another thing I want mention When someone creates Spotify playlist put album songs there don’t play once. What actually happens keep repeatedly playing them. What I think interesting here that sales cycle record anywhere four 12 weeks typical cases. With Spotify keep seeing effect 25 35 even year. So looking effect certain record release has one world Spotify look first 12 weeks actually look six months probably even year after keeps playing. And every time someone plays song pay music industry. I think probably biggest misunderstanding everyone keeps comparing apple what’s actually apple hopefully tastier fruit. Evolver.fm:Â It seems like would give musicians incentive make music people want listen again could good culturally. It’s making splash. Ek:Â Yeah At Spotify really want democratically win musician. We want win music best music. And way win Spotify ecosystem unless buy advertising friends recommending friends. And listening music. They vote hands feet. I think that’s pretty great thing artist that’s creating great music. What’s interesting me looking greatest acts last year many acts acts that five 10 years ago may even record deal they’ve grown one favorite bands Mumford Sons. I don’t know much growing social I tell you reason I discovered someone actually sent YouTube clip I started searching Spotify I discovered fantastic band. I guess point future we’re getting connected world hopefully mean great music prevail friends listen share friends. Spotify send music via Apple AirPlay home stereos devices. Evolver.fm:Â The two big areas growth digital music seem car television. What tell us Spotify’s strategy there. Ek:Â Much like believe strength CD ubiquitous take CD put player press play that’s easy want play music Spotify. As devices getting connected base people want listen music devices increase that’s something we’re hugely excited Evolver.fm:Â To switch gears second I interested cover Spotify apps. You build desktop apps Spotify’s catalog iOS apps build apps within Spotify desktop client. How significant see ecosystem Is going major part Spotify’s growth future. Ek:Â Yeah definitely believe that. There multiple ways one look this we’re trying primarily address comes music we’ve got 15 16 million tracks. I don’t even know exact number is there’s endless amount music. You could listen whole life Spotify catalog probably wouldn’t get third it. What’s needed top curated experiences. Part curated experience people building playlists sharing playlists friends. But another part trusted sources people tend really really good music. There things music aren’t Spotify’s core like lyrics ticketing things. We felt Internet really silent music missing. We wanted create platform allow people interact music whether that’s providing curation providing interesting experiences even using give venues ticketing merchandising. We think things super exciting they’re core competency. We might 100 150 engineers that’s great already now Spotify platform we’ve got thousands engineers working creating interesting music experiences. And that’s ultimately really good music industry avenues listen music interact music. Ultimately that’s going make people care music pay again. Spotify runs iPad many devices courtesy Flickr/Andreas Blixt). Evolver.fm:Â We’ve talked little bit royalty payouts. Some people said time time payouts low others point hundreds millions dollars changing hands low A artists deciding releases Spotify I guess one conclusion draw would it’s difficult freemium streaming pay seem like high royalties one sense but per-artist level people say it’s much. How see playing out. Ek:Â As I said lot people try compare apple another fruit I started saying look us infancy. We haven’t even started really. We’re still really young company. So ultimately view royalty checks we’re paying course we’re happy there’s progress made it’s still early days keep growing. Last year great testament that May hit million paying customers end year two-and-a-half million. That’s significant increase customers paying 100 bucks year. And Spotify keeps growing pace faster. So I think royalty checks they’re combined definitely grow. But I also want kind caution people. We get lot media attention. People think we’re actively seeking media attention instances we’re not. People like product much like write it. I find I meet artists. They actually think we’re lot larger are. I say we’re not really. We’re roughly 10 million users countries where total 600 million people. And them least 250 million listening music online we’re actually small part right now.. I want add home country Sweden Spotify grown scale look artists now vast majority artists getting 50 60 percent income Spotify. And I think that’s what’s going happen model gets scale. And music industry Sweden growing. Evolver.fm:Â The latest thing Spotify Facebook ability listen thing time I think fantastic feature. It makes music something person MP3 player pair headphones. Over long term going become mainstream activity people like use latest stuff get kick it. Ek:Â Our approach don’t know. With said think music social thing is think people want interact music. The background feature actually built Facebook think cool. One engineers showed one time I came visit like think this? I said awesome release it.. The coolest thing could build feature Spotify platform could interact APIs create it put service. We didn’t actually interact much get done one things Facebook folks really passionate about I think I hope I believe 10 projects similar around Web right now people build cool interesting experiences. Two weeks ago someone created Spotify app Soundrop released iOS app. So now sudden I room I’m walking around people talk music vote track come next. It’s kind social radio. And built two guys Oslo. I guess answer don’t know work not we’re thrilled people want innovate around it. Evolver.fm:Â So still find time play guitar. Ek:Â I do I actually bought travel guitar guitar really cool. You actually fold guitar plug headphones it it’s acoustic semi-acoustic. So I more actually I last year.

Where films progress linear fashion Morisset takes things step further maybe sideways. Through simple interactions like scrolling mouse across computer screen complicated ones like dancing front webcam Morisset’s films ask audience participate unfolding narrative. His approach tailor-made web 2.0. Just Facebook Twitter worthwhile users get involved Morisset’s work truly comes alive audience input. Readers may know Morisset’s work involvement Grammy-winning band Arcade Fire worked since 2004 breakout album Funeral. Since then he’s created music videos interactive web content 2009 documentary Mirroir Noir alongside band. Most recently directed beautifully unsettling video Sprawl II Beyond Mountains)\, Arcade Fire’s latest single. The video presents characters whose behaviors mimic viewer. Dance quickly music characters same slow they’ll follow suit. If stop dancing altogether characters stop progressing movements stuck endless loop. Morisset also worked Icelandic post-rockers Sigur Ros directing band’s concert film Inni may traditional film though methods creation anything but. He shot edited movie digital HD transferred black-and-white film projecting onto screen recording projection 16mm cameras. The 16mm version movie projected Morisset collaborators improvised manipulations using found objects. Then filmed edited version using digital HD equipment. The result uncanny promotional materials accurately describe near-monochromatic tunnel visionâ€¦[inviting intimacy claustrophobia. We recently spoke Morisset ideas behind work collaborating musicians complicated relationship technology. interview edited length clarity.. Andy Cush Evolver.fm I wanted start asking background especially interactive side art. How come work particular format. Vincent Morisset Director When I younger I wanted go cinema I went school direction. When I university I communication program. You decide whether go TV cinema radio. The year I choose profile opened new program called multimedia fit personality. I’m guy touch every aspect it I jumped program. This late path kind changed point. For couple years I’d mainly developing graphic-based websites time limitation medium. In beginning bandwidth allowed us play video point two loves I may say joined back together. I started video-based projects. I part team people I guy comfortable technology. I don’t consider geek. I don’t love programming I learned code Lingo ActionScript make projects happen. So I kind self-taught programming background time I studied cinema. At point two backgrounds collided I started call interactive video. Evolver.fm Do see technology worth pursuing it’s making something high-tech tools available Or means achieve artistic vision. Morisset I’m geek. I’m really excited technology sake. I think offers amazing possibilities I’m one guys get excited it. Ideas always drive projects I use tools around achieve them. I think it’s important understand possibilities limitations tools me it’s important projects driven ideas don’t become technology demos whatever. Evolver.fm A lot work though technologically impressive manages feel handmade human animations interactive film Bla Bla instance homespun quality newest Arcade Fire video II\"]. Morisset Thanks. I think there’s paradox relationship technology. In way I love it. One mottos web fun. I love platform I love medium way connect images laptop really different way relate images TV screen. Since I want trigger emotions projects I work hard kind forget we’re front computer. We forget technology feels like kind weird magical thing reacting do. Evolver.fm Would talk little bit II video processes behind it came be. Morisset I’ve working band forever back since Funeral ongoing creative collaboration going on. When recording The Suburbs\,Â I working artistic director whole visual aspect artwork juggling different ideas various projects. For while I wanted develop interactive video project would free interface thing that’s really spontaneous primitive. I showed really basic little demo Regine Arcade Fire's singer/multi-instrumentalist] waved hand webcam triggered sounds flickered screen. She said thought they’d song little pop kind song could dance to she’d play done. At end ended Sprawl II. It kind disco-ish me fit perfectly concept. So time passed I worked projects end album cycle I like really this.. The band totally dance-activated video wanted make sure people without webcam good computer would still able sense world creating decided kind hybrid project. We would traditional film could seen YouTube TV parallel would interactive video. That kind challenge shoot I two parallel projects two totally different mediums. Evolver.fm Thematically album seems conflicted state modern life know it video dovetails nicely that. You created images that times almost feel like home video presented new confusing context. A still Morisset's interactive video Sprawl II. Morisset We wanted something would really simple straightforward boring. So asked like music videos decided make something felt spontaneous fun bit strangeness added. It’s always funny I first show project different kinds people. When start understand cause effect gestures echo choreography there’s moment they’re like They get bit freaked out. And pass moment kind assimilate make video own. It’s funny different people interact depending personality cultural background. Some people analytical it people let loose. It’s funny see people connect piece like that. Evolver.fm The interactivity makes much whatever baggage you’re bringing table spectator artist put it. Morisset It also connects song about. There’s character alienated environment wants get loose escape alienating environment. The fact dance front computer also bit liberating kind weird you’re context normally dance. You’re work computer living room there’s moment cross tiny boundary. Evolver.fm One criticisms often hear internet culture causes people short attention spans media consume. Because interactive work mostly experienced online nature\,Â there’s good chance people won’t give full attention others perceive frivolous. Does bother all. Morisset No all. I like gray area music video culture. There’s something really exciting niche you’re juggling two worlds. You connect broad audience you’re able propose things unusual sometimes bit challenging. It’s okay people see one way another. It’s part process part game. I quite like fact able reach kinds people present different contexts. At point don’t control contexts piece re-presented in don’t know people look it. And I think that’s kind cool. Evolver.fm Yeah must pretty exciting. Just releasing wild. Morisset You need embrace that. It’s part web is. Evolver.fm There seems connection music lot work even stuff isn’t commissioned band. When began career artist know you’d close relationship music Or something evolved own. Morisset Your life accidents happy accidents. The fact I started work Arcade Fire something like eight years ago led projects bounced projects projects people asking work them. In last years I’ve lucky enough work amazing artists. I would say it’s kind theory encounters. I didn’t look music-related projects kind happened like that. And I must say I decided next year I’d like explore things.Â But I love music I think there’s strong connection music image especially interactive stuff. When you’re playing non-linear editing music gives thing kind emotional spine. It gives structure. Even you’re playing something that’s really reactive least backbone keep tension dramatic crescendos piece. So it’s something really useful artist working interactive material I don’t way pigeonholed music stuff. Like I said before I like touch kinds things. Evolver.fm Something attracted Inni hands-on analog manipulation film guys doing. You’re taking something originally filmed digitally HD working it like would clay paint physical artistic object. Could explain process. Morisset I see traditional film. It’s linear hour long I took lot expertise I developed web projects process. I’m always trying destroy slick perfect bit soulless look computer-ish imagery. In Bla Bla same. I old school stop motion puppet rotoscoped face 3D I could map mouth eyes real time. So I working something really fragile imperfect using sophisticated technology along it. With Inni it’s kind way around. We took advantage really light-sensitive cameras able edit film straightforward efficient way. But too-crisp feel almost like watching news TV. It kind killed magic aura Sigur Ros is. So I thought we’d try spontaneous approach post-production. When I pitched idea Sigur Ros I comparing Neil Young Dead Man soundtrack. He sat front Jim Jarmusch film guitar looking first time jammed it. There’s really volatile imperfect thing makes alive beautiful. Again computers amazing things there’s something organic handmade stuff. You can’t fake it. You need put hands dirt it. Evolver.fm Tell synchronized artwork The Suburbs. Morisset Well I think there’s lot potential really straightforward way presenting digital content synchronized song. It struck people haven’t embraced path. I like I thought cool idea. Why aren’t people it It’s kind no-brainer. It makes sense 2012 we’re still stuck JPEG whole album. It’s bizarre. It’s blocked Apple way. It couldn’t sold store it’s standard MP3s it’s exactly app either. Evolver.fm It reminds little bit BjÃ¶rk’s Biophilia suite apps. Obviously they’re different seem piece way looking album format asking could differently 2012?. Morisset With BjÃ¶rk thing need get app listen song. You’re kind forced involved it. For me listening music something go ways. I remember sitting couch I younger opening vinyl sleeve reading lyrics. But I’m bus I don’t want hold record sleeve. I want put sleep put pocket still able listen it. I still want put random songs I still want able put tracks playlist. The BjÃ¶rk thing cool itself I would love could embedded listening environment. If you’re that can’t anything else. If listen app album you’re that virtual booklet open times. Evolver.fm Have seen interactive work bands people inspires you. Morisset It’s interactive I likeÂ Radio Soulwax. It’s set mixtapes evolving artwork. Evolver.fm Is anything happening world mainstream narrative film that’s got excited Is world would ever consider trying work in. Morisset I’m embracing traditional linear films. I’ve done two films it’s world I’m totally unfamiliar with.Â One thing I think exciting films get around now. I think we’re verge changing distribution consume films films bit niche able reach audience easily. I think Mirroir Noir Arcade Fire documentary one first feature films originally distributed online. When first came out way could see buy online download HD video.Â It bit peculiar film festivals theater screenings. At end I think successful able reach single day whole fan community. And people wanted see film. I think gone traditional path people would found torrent wanted pirate wanted see badly. So way short-circuited threat way good. After that film got screened theaters film events. So film’s life inverted good way.

Ek give keynote address GRAMMY Foundationâ€TMs Entertainment Law Initiative Luncheon Scholarship Presentation Feb. 10 Beverly Hills Calif. For information GRAMMY Foundation visit www.grammyfoundation.org. The 54th Annual GRAMMY Awards airs live Sunday Feb. 12 CBS. Eliot Van Buskirk Evolver.fm It’s year since last met. How things going lately. Daniel Ek CEO Spotify I’ve got bit sore throat right now you’re asking personally Spotify fantastic. That’s always great. Evolver.fm Can give us preview intend discuss GRAMMY Foundation’s Entertainment Law Initiative Luncheon. Ek There’s lot interesting debate going streaming I like it’s become streaming what’s free not. But I really want talk future. We debate right now I still think streaming really infancy I want outline future looks like actually mean music industry. What would mean promote act Or revenues. We’re time people saying actually working\, we’ve got two-and-a-half million paying customers number growing very quickly keeps accelerating. Personally speaking I bullish future music industry ever before I think we’re kind entering golden age music. Evolver.fm:Â What golden age look like. Spotify gets political Barack Obama's reelection campaigners posted Spotify playlist featuring favorite songs including president's. Ek:Â First I think we’re talking world where I believe access. There ownership well. I think total amount revenues back industry going grow. We’ve paid $200 million rightsholders already it’s still early days. So me part talking growth story get music industry back used be probably even past that. The second part is world music really listening music friends discovering you mean break acts promote acts Spotify now hasn’t really done great job helping that you’re going see us break acts try really promote well. Looking Spotify today fast-forwarding three years 2015 Where’s music industry Where’s Spotify mean band manager label I think it’s exciting times. Creating record really three core components. The first thing creating actual record. It used really expensive now really anyone record record even homes. The second piece used really expensive distributing record iTunes Spotify services distributing another digital copy basically doesn’t cost anything. But funny thing is marketing used kind simple old days. You used able put radio MTV worked. If good song record started selling based that. Today media landscape much fragmented. MTV’s music anymore radio even hard[er break through. There tons radio channels play stuff people already know. So marketing act today really really really expensive. If went broadcast medium getting everyone social medium music discovered friends mean marketing music I think that’s core component getting work. Evolver.fm:Â That’s really good point. I guess we’re also seeing audio ads within Spotify clips songs. Ek:Â Hopefully I’ll also able go interesting things we’ve seen address] especially Facebook acts like Foster The People kind blew service really friends started discovering people. That’s great story us show works. People discovered radio didn’t much promotion friends kept recommending listening it friends turn discovered it.. Evolver.fm:Â Is part decision require Facebook login Spotify see social sharing important. Ek We look sharing music really really important business. We’ve found social users i.e. they’re sharing music faster grow music library. faster grow music library faster become paying customers. That’s really rationale us really marketing side feel combination Spotify positive thing. Evolver.fm:Â I remember first met New York years ago said wanted create legal version sort experience people P2P version. My favorite thing Napster searching one rare band I loved. If someone that I trusted them knew I going like anything else had. Ek:Â Yep. Evolver.fm:Â It seems like succeeded translating legal music service congratulations that. Ek:Â Yes we’ve done that. Right now it’s skewed toward friends. What want make skew toward discovering people great music taste well. Evolver.fm:Â Are misunderstandings Spotify you’d like clear up. Ek:Â I feel extent we’re victim success. What I mean is especially look media Spotify seen gigantic company size iTunes really true. We’re really starting here that’s feel it. If look country like U.S. there’s sub-1 percent population that’s even using legal streaming service. I think sometimes people perceive us lot larger are that’s important point make. Spotify CEO Daniel Ek unveils company's app strategy New York event Eliot Van Buskirk). point I want make very different model selling record. Everyone talks volume means terms numbers I don’t think it’s comparable. In world today 500 million people listening music online. Out them there’s small portion avid iTunes customers look today majority digital music ecosystem. So way we’re approaching is want reach 500 million people vast majority aren’t really using iTunes. I’d also like address people think they’ll gain sales Spotify. There’s shred data suggest that. In fact information available points streaming services helping drive sales. Album unit sales U.S. 2011 year Spotify launched first time since 2004. More dozen albums debuted number one available Spotify launch. Spotify users exact people used listen music every day YouTube whose entire music collection pulled BitTorrent sites. By offering compelling music service allows discover hundreds new artists favorites pulled YouTube we’re seeing millions move back listening music legally years left cold. They’re helping pay ton money back industry. You’re talking 10 million active users 2.5 million subscribers paying $120 year double amount average iTunes user. Do really want hold back album people finally paying music again If think you’re getting buy album CD album download again there’s absolutely evidence back theory up. Your album’s getting shared en masse BitTorrent YouTube. It’s there right decide it’s paying loyal music fans lose out. It makes sense. Another thing I want mention When someone creates Spotify playlist put album songs there don’t play once. What actually happens keep repeatedly playing them. What I think interesting here that sales cycle record anywhere four 12 weeks typical cases. With Spotify keep seeing effect 25 35 even year. So looking effect certain record release has one world Spotify look first 12 weeks actually look six months probably even year after keeps playing. And every time someone plays song pay music industry. I think probably biggest misunderstanding everyone keeps comparing apple what’s actually apple hopefully tastier fruit. Evolver.fm:Â It seems like would give musicians incentive make music people want listen again could good culturally. It’s making splash. Ek:Â Yeah At Spotify really want democratically win musician. We want win music best music. And way win Spotify ecosystem unless buy advertising friends recommending friends. And listening music. They vote hands feet. I think that’s pretty great thing artist that’s creating great music. What’s interesting me looking greatest acts last year many acts acts that five 10 years ago may even record deal they’ve grown one favorite bands Mumford Sons. I don’t know much growing social I tell you reason I discovered someone actually sent YouTube clip I started searching Spotify I discovered fantastic band. I guess point future we’re getting connected world hopefully mean great music prevail friends listen share friends. Spotify send music via Apple AirPlay home stereos devices. Evolver.fm:Â The two big areas growth digital music seem car television. What tell us Spotify’s strategy there. Ek:Â Much like believe strength CD ubiquitous take CD put player press play that’s easy want play music Spotify. As devices getting connected base people want listen music devices increase that’s something we’re hugely excited Evolver.fm:Â To switch gears second I interested cover Spotify apps. You build desktop apps Spotify’s catalog iOS apps build apps within Spotify desktop client. How significant see ecosystem Is going major part Spotify’s growth future. Ek:Â Yeah definitely believe that. There multiple ways one look this we’re trying primarily address comes music we’ve got 15 16 million tracks. I don’t even know exact number is there’s endless amount music. You could listen whole life Spotify catalog probably wouldn’t get third it. What’s needed top curated experiences. Part curated experience people building playlists sharing playlists friends. But another part trusted sources people tend really really good music. There things music aren’t Spotify’s core like lyrics ticketing things. We felt Internet really silent music missing. We wanted create platform allow people interact music whether that’s providing curation providing interesting experiences even using give venues ticketing merchandising. We think things super exciting they’re core competency. We might 100 150 engineers that’s great already now Spotify platform we’ve got thousands engineers working creating interesting music experiences. And that’s ultimately really good music industry avenues listen music interact music. Ultimately that’s going make people care music pay again. Spotify runs iPad many devices courtesy Flickr/Andreas Blixt). Evolver.fm:Â We’ve talked little bit royalty payouts. Some people said time time payouts low others point hundreds millions dollars changing hands low A artists deciding releases Spotify I guess one conclusion draw would it’s difficult freemium streaming pay seem like high royalties one sense but per-artist level people say it’s much. How see playing out. Ek:Â As I said lot people try compare apple another fruit I started saying look us infancy. We haven’t even started really. We’re still really young company. So ultimately view royalty checks we’re paying course we’re happy there’s progress made it’s still early days keep growing. Last year great testament that May hit million paying customers end year two-and-a-half million. That’s significant increase customers paying 100 bucks year. And Spotify keeps growing pace faster. So I think royalty checks they’re combined definitely grow. But I also want kind caution people. We get lot media attention. People think we’re actively seeking media attention instances we’re not. People like product much like write it. I find I meet artists. They actually think we’re lot larger are. I say we’re not really. We’re roughly 10 million users countries where total 600 million people. And them least 250 million listening music online we’re actually small part right now.. I want add home country Sweden Spotify grown scale look artists now vast majority artists getting 50 60 percent income Spotify. And I think that’s what’s going happen model gets scale. And music industry Sweden growing. Evolver.fm:Â The latest thing Spotify Facebook ability listen thing time I think fantastic feature. It makes music something person MP3 player pair headphones. Over long term going become mainstream activity people like use latest stuff get kick it. Ek:Â Our approach don’t know. With said think music social thing is think people want interact music. The background feature actually built Facebook think cool. One engineers showed one time I came visit like think this? I said awesome release it.. The coolest thing could build feature Spotify platform could interact APIs create it put service. We didn’t actually interact much get done one things Facebook folks really passionate about I think I hope I believe 10 projects similar around Web right now people build cool interesting experiences. Two weeks ago someone created Spotify app Soundrop released iOS app. So now sudden I room I’m walking around people talk music vote track come next. It’s kind social radio. And built two guys Oslo. I guess answer don’t know work not we’re thrilled people want innovate around it. Evolver.fm:Â So still find time play guitar. Ek:Â I do I actually bought travel guitar guitar really cool. You actually fold guitar plug headphones it it’s acoustic semi-acoustic. So I more actually I last year.

First nominations two tracks - Muppet Muppets In Rio animated film - making cut. Then start week Deadline broke news neither song would performed part Oscar telecast seemingly ever-vain hope keeping running time ceremony three hours despite protestations behind two films many others. category always somewhat extraneous side-bar best Björk Dark\, Robin Williams leading high-kicking mounties rendition Canada\, Glen Hansard Marketa Inglova performing winning Slowly provide biggest talking points night. The move honor nominees year unprecedented also skipped two years ago) seems signify lack confidence category Academy possible signifier place may long world. It's principally fault music branch's new voting system. The short version process song film score average 8.25 become nominee although contenders make mark two highest picked may well case year. It's worst possible system hopefully scrapped future years. assuming branch got shit together worthier nominees two rather mediocre ones picked Well yes fact. Below we've picked five original songs deserved place list merit alone could livened Academy Awards broadcast end. We've kept eligible songs - written specifically film featuring body movie first song end credits - still found plenty worthier In Rio. Listen picks below. A Happy Song Jason Segel Amy Adams Walter Feist Mickey Rooney Muppets\" Muppets\, closest thing original live-action musical we've time always going get one nomination testament songwriter's branch somehow managed nominate least engaging song film. Or Muppet sort fun resist upbeat catchy charms A Happy Song\, Bret McKenzie-penned opening number highlight soundtrack also whole film It's earworm got big laughs puppets solo showcase A-lister Amy Adams even opportunity get 91-year-old veteran Mickey Rooney stage one-line cameo. Not nominating one suggests even songwriters branch care category anymore. Tonight Alex Turner least one actual voters can't blamed whatever reason film's less stellar box office performance) The Weinstein Company seemingly chose submit Arctic Monkeys frontman Alex Turner's six original compositions make soundtrack Richard Ayoade's charming debut consideration. It's awful shame picture year closely interweaved song-score film meant point category. Turner who's still mere 26 one gifted songwriters generation melding melody incisive witty lyrics swooning Tonight highlight work although really tunes could made cut. You Can Wait The National ft. Sharon Van Etten Win\" one caused little internal debate even The Playlist's head honchos less enamored The National's brand muscular Springsteen-indebted rock writer admit contribution Tom McCarthy's Win deserving nomination 95 field. A trademark ballad male inadequacy self-destruction featuring backing vocals Brooklyn singer-songwriter Sharon Van Etten beautiful little number given huge band gotten days could made performance helped bring new viewers telecast. Maybe placement film's end credits in alas we'll never know. Theme The Chemical Brothers ft. Stephanie Dosen one never submitted consideration sole vocal track Chemical Brothers score Joe Wright's pop-art actioner Featuring haunting vocals singer-songwriter occasional Massive Attack member Stephanie Dosen neat crystalization childlike fairy-tale feel film. But looking get dancefllor score afraid unleash block-rocking beats needed. There's basically precedent something sort nominated performed show can't say livened things up certainly deserves merit. video official embed could find make jump YouTube hear it. Ben Nichols Shelter\" Shelter exactly kind movie Best Original Song category usually features neither theme tune Ben Nichols frontman Memphis band Lucero. But then two years since Weary Kind Heart Oscar last year saw Strong Strong nominated inconceivable something like featured Nichols acoustic country-tinged ballad far robust song nominations certainly interesting bigger stars like Mary J. Blige Chris Cornell. Plus Michael Shannon missing actor nomination would nice bit exposure film needed more. Also Worthy Spangled Man America The First Avenger comes multiple nominee Alan Menken would made pretty impressive production number Zaz's Valant pretty little French tune could brought little international flavor. Meanwhile Elvis Costello She Him Jónsi also songs respectively Day\, The Pooh Bought Zoo\" that far best work deserving In Rio. Speaking of going nominate song highlight Bird\, genuinely funny showcase film's villain Nigel voiced Jemaine Clement Which nothing else would made category showdown two members Flight Conchords. Finally Three Six Mafia win Hard Out There For A Pimp\, That Snitch Block?

Have something different imagination second thought designs look vector-ish.. I dunno something looks different... send message. This entertaining. But bird eagle. send message. Well I guess could one actually. send message. Too many colors... It's really hard tell color halftones also makes question fineness halftones display purposes. send message. All halftones one standard size display detail closeup top corner halftones used shading badger scarves lion's mane snake's body. I used technique many designs past nice thing prints way almost indistinguishable simply using extra colors. It works really well halftones consistent size rather set gradient makes much cleaner printing since fade infinitely small size rather uniform send message. hahaha I love this. send message. o.. maybe that's looks different I crazy. Either way sounds like good way halftone I'll look since I photoshop newb. send message. Hmm interesting sounding. I would interested seeing close-ups various multi-colored areas. I've trying watch various ways halftoning done around lately method makes strong difference shrunken preview image way makes impressive forms halftone shrinking. Do apply particular varied angle And use angle different patches color different angles different colors etc send message. This shirt connection topic all. A badger one four mascots Hogwarts houses. The fact eating snake weird - makes sense - put topic. send message. I always apply angle degrees) backgrounds solid colored areas I use round halftone shading I use line halftone.

The Google employee Googley Jon Rockway said good users internet large\". It's surprising statement Google employee make I've asking SEO experts views issue whether reflects search giant's real views. Instead able SEO entire Internet businesses affect search results tiny percentage users. That's good thing SEO can't scale SEO good users Internet large. If look Google experience standpoint customers pretty good. Users get relevant search results ads. Advertisers get content top everything else. It's good compromise advertising usability works really well. It's bug could rank highly Google without buying ads Google trying fix bug. Manipulating Google results something feel entitled able do. If want rank highly Google relevant user currently searching. Engage social media email provide relevant information selling and generally match user wants. Search consultant Rishi Lakhani feels Rockway revealing could much internal sentiment Google stance free traffic\". It kind reminds old SEO joke What Meaning SPAM Search Positions Above Mine. However Google’s view SPAM could mean Search Positions Avoid Moneymaking. Essentially Google’s money making model Selling Ads. Every bit free traffic site receives organic search loss revenue Google. So surprised stance I not. Andrew Girdwood Bigmouthmedia I lot sympathy Rockway’s comment. SEO attempts manipulate Google’s Bing’s search results less relevant results returned relevant results good users internet. I don’t believe single more. Some SEO throwbacks perhaps new strands fall helpful category. Spam example helpful. Yes plenty spammers there good SEO benefits businesses web users. Here those. As Site Visibility's Kelvin Newman points out many improvements website usability made order optimise search engines There’s lots annoying aspects websites SEO role killing off I think good Karma SEO ending trend splash pages enough see industry decade bad behaviour. Elizabeth Ayers iCrossing echoes sentiment If large quality brands optimise sites search likely web would poorer place. The web social would advanced today SEO hadn’t key revenue driver brands take advantage participate in creating quality content participating social platforms. Content key great SEO cheap tactics like keyword stuffing cut more. Instead creating content people want read share works best. Andrew Girdwood. Modern SEO helpful. It less advertising tactic marketing strategy. Modern SEO involves creating working engaging content content good users want share discuss it. This boon users net creates upwards pressure quality. Rishi Lakhani. Competitive SEO actually helps make businesses even relevant searchers. Because know links naturally why. A page full carburettors sale may get links motivation But page shows clean carburettor will. The difference intent motivation differs it’s SEO community hard work encouraging content. SEO bad user Google’s pockets. There businesses spending big bucks SEO paid search using solid SEO techniques creating usable site filling great content small businesses rank higher bigger rivals. Andrew Girdwood. A strong example Modern SEO great users general emergence social CRM. Businesses increasing efforts look customers online using platforms like Twitter Google reach people bad experience brand encountered problem. This part due rise social also example Modern SEO. Google blogged back 2010 bad customers bad business. Customers benefit whenever brands take extra effort look convergence search social given business extra incentive that. Is real subtext statement gaff not As Rockway says thanks recent changes Plus' amount Google homepage real estate open influence SEO shrinking. So Google seeking minimise role SEO Rishi Lakhani feels strongly this. Of course bad approaches SEO. However attitude SEO=SPAM stop. Because biggest violators Google themselves. It takes content third party sites slowly wraps ads. Google gets short term partnerships businesses edge learn processes use build offering terminate relationships. Up years ago Google used use Yell supply local content. Now it’s overtaken Google Local. For years Google taking money credit card companies comparison sites alike.

Posted 09 February 2012 12:01pm dan barker 10 comments This post highlights simple useful feature that's crept onto UK's largest e-commerce sites last couple years real coverage. promo strip new slowly caught point almost standard high street retailers yet still fairly rare smaller sites. It's useful addition customer perspective informative without overbearing brand perspective orientated without overbearing!. There 12 examples below including variations central idea. Here's example basic version Play.com. That's it. A simple strip key information appears top navigation site performing roughly similar function direct mail Johnson Box. Sometimes promote key selling points site brand itself times highlight current promotions though really they're nice way display info want visitor site see. Below 11 examples trend. In screengrab promo strip highlighted green. There's theme among biggest retailers use strip delivery messaging. John Lewis promote delivery threshold collect delivery info along famous Knowingly Undersold'. Evans follow trend Delivery Returns information also include call action sign email list. Again Topshop opt UK Delivery delivery promo. House Fraser copycat John Lewis maybe way round collection' delivery' delivery promoted prominently here. And again Debenhams follows along Free Delivery store collection international delivery. Other standard delivery pick store' variations retailers who've gone little further. M&S step things nicely competitors showing international UK delivery info also highlighting current promotions area every site visitor see. M&S almost always sales areas site allows retailer flag everyone lands site. Another retailer showing delivery returns info Boux Avenue worth mention whereas retailers lumped promo strip top existing design Boux folded neatly overall look/theme site. Naked's version differs slightly others. Firstly navigation. Secondly introduces urgency deadline next XX minutes next day delivery call action. Penhaligon's fill area dead space layout delivery info also usefully heavily gifted brand promotes free gift wrapping service here. As Naked Wines Pen Heaven focuses urgency offering day engraving orders particular time. It also features customer reviews heavily here great smaller brand visitors may heard of. Kiddicare probably UK's leading baby product website. also leads way promo strip. First beats standard promos next day delivery hour slots. Second shows 365 day return policy. Third Kiddicare offers price match promise. Taking far further retailer added strips either side main content. These strips hidden smaller resolution 1024x768. For anyone larger monitor reinforce price match fast despatch also show many awards promote 119\,000 product reviews. As see popped place. They're simple addition highlight features info want show visitors. If run e-commerce site already tried this worth testing. If already running bog standard delivery worth trialing ideas see impact have. There nice extensions too personalising include discount codes depending traffic source etc. If willing A/B test it probably worth paying attention impact visitors first time buyers rather overall conversion rate. Do leave comment seen interesting examples this experience around results. Dan Barker E-Business Consultant guest blogger Econsultancy. Problems checkout process still biggest single source revenue loss e-commerce businesses. This report identifies 70 awesome recommendations includes lots practical insight help reduce checkout abandonment rates. Alternatively see The Future Digital Marketing 2010 Presentations E-commerce Platforms Buyer's Guide. Head Usability Conversion PRWD. 12:36PM 9th February 2012. Great article Dan highlighting something I talking presenting ideas last 12 months. The promo strip great example design pattern I seeing users actively engage user testing sessions. Your summary benefits feature spot too... useful addition customer perspective informative without overbearing brand perspective orientated without overbearing!). Picking Naked Wines example provided fact featured countdown timer since launched site superb way deliver persuasive technique sense urgency almost guarantee site visitors see even sub-consciously. A quick recommendation I make retailers implementing strips try cramming many messages space. If compare John Lewis Pen Heaven Kiddicare takes less effort scan latter two sites messages along using visual elements help differentiate messages. Thanks great post. E-Business Consultant Dan Barker. 12:54PM 9th February 2012. Thanks Paul And great advice. Interestingly I think Naked Wines design start. I could wrong I think original http://bit.ly/originalnw. I think makes nice point really useful test kind thing find works site audience business needs. Thanks again. dan. Senior Marketing Manager Personalisation MVT Tesco.com. 1:19PM 9th February 2012. Agree point quietly bubbling away many e-com sites without much focus. Very useful used right way. One thing I've seen contextualising personalising area pros cons associated used correctly could use profile data user first visit categories browsed etc provide persuasive prompting e.g. first time visitor provide generic deliver/returns/click collect/etc info start tailoring message visitor moves first time potential customer becoming customer etc.. within things fit brand male/female M&S example simply choosing whether display Men's Women's Trouser Offer. 1:31PM 9th February 2012. Great article Dan They fantastic examples persuading user without bombarding much information. I agree Paul scanning messages. How adding bit colour break different messages alongside leading text. Another great example ASOS really fantastic persuading customer journey. Ecommerce Director Eurosimm Ltd. 2:15PM 9th February 2012. Interesting see many retailers using bar promote delivery offerings. Perhaps customers familiar wider propositions need push choose us message. I'd advocate using bar push key USPs business particularly smaller less well known retailers fighting make mark. It would interesting see eye tracking studies survey people using sites featuring promo bars see content registers not. Given bar likely eyeline journey site I'd wager registers subconsciously even dont actively read it. Analyst CxFocus. 3:43PM 9th February 2012. Very interesting indeed. Thanks Dan. I think good patterns like start emerge. As top navigation side navigation email address password login even common one helps new visitors expectation things may be. I agree Albie choose us message important too. Not one examples much along lines. I think they're assuming everyone recognise them longer safe bet. But fact I think USP message need bigger prominent strips. One question Paul mention people engaging strips usability tests. Was mentioning loud actually clicking please I'm reassured either way often I find people manage miss even prominent messages. But I'm also slightly concerned someone's first reaction landing site click details something like this even demonstrate keen commercial intent. 3:49PM 9th February 2012. In instances displayed main page writer pointed appear pages. I believe could useful upsell checkout page. It distracts natural flow menu home page flow would cause consumers pause long enough wonder leave. A interesting study Albie would correlation eye tracking conversion rates I certainly agree great idea type distraction potentially loose customer used. It would unusual something like would incorporated original design site adding afterwords without breaking natural flow original design would difficult. I think excellent way drawer additional value site used moderation customer might naturally expect see it. Very nice article Dan. Cheers Robert. 9:13AM 10th February 2012. I've done research around area started call confidence banners since often aim directly convert call action merely instill confidence customer making likely make purchase later on. Analyst CxFocus. 11:14AM 10th February 2012. That's interesting Rich. What kind research do Or cheeky question I'm asking intrusive detail general type thing. 4:54PM 10th February 2012. Not Tim Mainly importance distinction two types banners we've come identify confidence banners conversion banners. Also general practice placement functionality each. Conversion banners usually prominent page containing direct call action. Copyright 2012 E-consultancy.com Limited. All rights reserved. This material personal use only.

The biggest change far introduction EU Privacy Law came effect 25th May 2011. It great surprise privacy bubbling surface industry last five years post Five Predictions For Web Analytics 2011) law interpreted shock web analytics world least across Europe. Sadly ICO Independent Commissioner’s Office UK responsible providing guidance enforce law taken view benign web tracking is anonymous aggregate visit data collected tools Google Analytics allowed without explicit consent visitor. That means force ugly intrusive pop-up window similar notice asking visitors consent. The ICO done top banner site seen drop 90 traffic able measure. Imagine impact would e-commerce site 90 data suddenly lost. Clearly wrong. The focus needs abusers online tracking people following best practice. This rumble throughout 2012 sure... As Google Analytics end user 2011 included mixture really annoying things data sampled data missing keywords) really innovative things. The GA team certainly busy hard keep track many new additions they've made tool. In 12 months we've seen introduction site speed metrics social media metrics brilliant multi-channel funnels improved dashboards reports flow analysis code improvements event tracking API. Not mention Google Analytics Premium big enough afford it. The Google Analytics updates great. They've updated year last years combined. I think move toward analysis really nice continue. Pulling different types data also really interesting I'd bet gets extended much further. From point view really nice trend last year people I work gone asking set reports? data? My dad published Kindle book year realised audience basis Google Analytics data. It's brilliant see lots people actually using amazing data that's available. The thing that's going mind everyone operates site EU forthcoming cookie legislation due enforced May. I'm sure agencies gain new business offering cookie audits policies tools obtain permission I think remains seen many even bother implement anything particularly initially. I think many likely see competitors look methods used obtain permission proposed far great. It would nice problem could simply passed back browser developers I think that's going happen. The analytics tool vendors also quiet issue. I'm hoping possible we'll able avoid prosecution taking fairly simple measures significantly harm user experience. I think 2012 could year long standing issue integrating offsite metrics onsite metrics comes age. The big offsite metrics questions people many saying away website i.e. social media. Because happens offsite many disparate systems/networks measurement correlation happens site far easy task achieve. The law mobile social analytics big topics next year. I think multichannel analytics analytics start go mainstream too automation based analytics data become bit easier. There's odd situation web analytics market moment Google Analytics serves 95 sites. The big Google Analytics let track personally identifiable information can't use answer even simple questions like biggest customers year what's bringing website often visiting?. To get answers either move niche web analytics tool pay mid/high five figures. Someone bound fix soon problem exists almost every website weird bulk web analytics far away customer-centric moment. BI web analytics keep moving closer together end year someone used words data Question Time cast TOWIE punch merits NoSQL. I hope better understanding privacy eyes law solidifies 2012. Privacy big issue anyone online simply easy present abused couple high profile cases could really harm ability website owners collect benign stuff. Bad practice go general new EU Privacy Law good thing. Bad practice includes surreptitious collection personal identifiable information sharing visit information 3rd parties 3rd party cookies similar techniques tracking visits different unrelated websites DoubleClick I like fact this. Of course explicit user consent problem otherwise clear no-no. I hoping good practice websites going caught bad stuff happening present... As someone heavily involved analytics implementation new features APIs appeal me. I'm big fan event tracking non-interactive event tracking addition great extra custom variables go amiss given Premium users get 50 compared mere five free version. A Google Analytics server-side import API would also nice would addition additional metrics improve quality reporting. On interface side enhancement brilliant new reports dashboards tools custom calculated metrics would icing cake. Graham Charlton Editor Econsultancy. Follow Twitter connect via Linkedin Google.

Excellent point PII bit Dan Maybe we'll see clarification terms use year Quite people seem using utma cookie visitor ID transaction ID same primary key allowing link GA data CRM offline analysis. However although allowed Premium GA apparently free version though I've seen people disputing this. If allowed would definitely take things another level Arguably storing anything else GA since ID one GA issued itself really personally identifiable. 4:50PM 5th January 2012. Some interesting thoughts mirroring own. I personally can't see EU ruling enforceable even think end getting stage. 12:06AM 6th January 2012.

The challenge law find new ways get visitors engage provide consent. I think good thing brands long run. Managing Director Lynchpin Analytics. 5:49PM 9th January 2012. A lot good debate converging analytics banner.. honest I'm quite sure belongs banner more tough gig crystal ball gazing. I suspect convergence web analytics business intelligence hinted much closer commonly acknowledged. If go BI conference read BI forum talking about actually using data collected better visualisations mashing data multiple sources predictive analytics big data platforms dynamic pricing etc etc.. All important industry trends around managing data driving business value it sources might different I struggle see much real divergence underlying objectives technologies.

Posted 05 January 2012 14:58pm Graham Charlton 27 comments We've already asked industry experts 2012 holds search e-commerce turn web analytics. 2011 busy year Google Analytics updates well EU Privacy law experts identify issues look next 12 months... The biggest change far introduction EU Privacy Law came effect 25th May 2011. It great surprise privacy bubbling surface industry last five years post Five Predictions For Web Analytics 2011) law interpreted shock web analytics world least across Europe. Sadly ICO Independent Commissioner’s Office UK responsible providing guidance enforce law taken view benign web tracking is anonymous aggregate visit data collected tools Google Analytics allowed without explicit consent visitor. That means force ugly intrusive pop-up window similar notice asking visitors consent. The ICO done top banner site seen drop 90 traffic able measure. Imagine impact would e-commerce site 90 data suddenly lost. Clearly wrong. The focus needs abusers online tracking people following best practice. This rumble throughout 2012 sure... As Google Analytics end user 2011 included mixture really annoying things data sampled data missing keywords) really innovative things. The GA team certainly busy hard keep track many new additions they've made tool. In 12 months we've seen introduction site speed metrics social media metrics brilliant multi-channel funnels improved dashboards reports flow analysis code improvements event tracking API. Not mention Google Analytics Premium big enough afford it. The Google Analytics updates great. They've updated year last years combined. I think move toward analysis really nice continue. Pulling different types data also really interesting I'd bet gets extended much further. From point view really nice trend last year people I work gone asking set reports? data? My dad published Kindle book year realised audience basis Google Analytics data. It's brilliant see lots people actually using amazing data that's available. The thing that's going mind everyone operates site EU forthcoming cookie legislation due enforced May. I'm sure agencies gain new business offering cookie audits policies tools obtain permission I think remains seen many even bother implement anything particularly initially. I think many likely see competitors look methods used obtain permission proposed far great. It would nice problem could simply passed back browser developers I think that's going happen. The analytics tool vendors also quiet issue. I'm hoping possible we'll able avoid prosecution taking fairly simple measures significantly harm user experience. I think 2012 could year long standing issue integrating offsite metrics onsite metrics comes age. The big offsite metrics questions people many saying away website i.e. social media. Because happens offsite many disparate systems/networks measurement correlation happens site far easy task achieve. The law mobile social analytics big topics next year. I think multichannel analytics analytics start go mainstream too automation based analytics data become bit easier. There's odd situation web analytics market moment Google Analytics serves 95 sites. The big Google Analytics let track personally identifiable information can't use answer even simple questions like biggest customers year what's bringing website often visiting?. To get answers either move niche web analytics tool pay mid/high five figures. Someone bound fix soon problem exists almost every website weird bulk web analytics far away customer-centric moment. BI web analytics keep moving closer together end year someone used words data Question Time cast TOWIE punch merits NoSQL. I hope better understanding privacy eyes law solidifies 2012. Privacy big issue anyone online simply easy present abused couple high profile cases could really harm ability website owners collect benign stuff. Bad practice go general new EU Privacy Law good thing. Bad practice includes surreptitious collection personal identifiable information sharing visit information 3rd parties 3rd party cookies similar techniques tracking visits different unrelated websites DoubleClick I like fact this. Of course explicit user consent problem otherwise clear no-no. I hoping good practice websites going caught bad stuff happening present... As someone heavily involved analytics implementation new features APIs appeal me. I'm big fan event tracking non-interactive event tracking addition great extra custom variables go amiss given Premium users get 50 compared mere five free version. A Google Analytics server-side import API would also nice would addition additional metrics improve quality reporting. On interface side enhancement brilliant new reports dashboards tools custom calculated metrics would icing cake. Graham Charlton Editor Econsultancy. Follow Twitter connect via Linkedin Google.

Excellent point PII bit Dan Maybe we'll see clarification terms use year Quite people seem using utma cookie visitor ID transaction ID same primary key allowing link GA data CRM offline analysis. However although allowed Premium GA apparently free version though I've seen people disputing this. If allowed would definitely take things another level Arguably storing anything else GA since ID one GA issued itself really personally identifiable. 4:50PM 5th January 2012. Some interesting thoughts mirroring own. I personally can't see EU ruling enforceable even think end getting stage. 12:06AM 6th January 2012. It would comforting believe Tom Hicks right can ostrich like carry regardless repercussions I'm sure Just Matt Clarke highlighted little seems done address issue little information available easily comply published like ICO site itself lend pleasing customer experience likely annoy provide confidence. 9:09AM 6th January 2012. If 95 analytics controlled Google I'd suggest job get sensible fix sorted applied globally. Group Head Data Intelligence Netbooster Guava Netbooster. 9:11AM 6th January 2012.

The Google employee Googley Jon Rockway said good users internet large\". It's surprising statement Google employee make I've asking SEO experts views issue whether reflects search giant's real views. Instead able SEO entire Internet businesses affect search results tiny percentage users. That's good thing SEO can't scale SEO good users Internet large. If look Google experience standpoint customers pretty good. Users get relevant search results ads. Advertisers get content top everything else. It's good compromise advertising usability works really well. It's bug could rank highly Google without buying ads Google trying fix bug. Manipulating Google results something feel entitled able do. If want rank highly Google relevant user currently searching. Engage social media email provide relevant information selling and generally match user wants. Search consultant Rishi Lakhani feels Rockway revealing could much internal sentiment Google stance free traffic\". It kind reminds old SEO joke What Meaning SPAM Search Positions Above Mine. However Google’s view SPAM could mean Search Positions Avoid Moneymaking. Essentially Google’s money making model Selling Ads. Every bit free traffic site receives organic search loss revenue Google. So surprised stance I not. Andrew Girdwood Bigmouthmedia I lot sympathy Rockway’s comment. SEO attempts manipulate Google’s Bing’s search results less relevant results returned relevant results good users internet. I don’t believe single more. Some SEO throwbacks perhaps new strands fall helpful category. Spam example helpful. Yes plenty spammers there good SEO benefits businesses web users. Here those. As Site Visibility's Kelvin Newman points out many improvements website usability made order optimise search engines There’s lots annoying aspects websites SEO role killing off I think good Karma SEO ending trend splash pages enough see industry decade bad behaviour. Elizabeth Ayers iCrossing echoes sentiment If large quality brands optimise sites search likely web would poorer place. The web social would advanced today SEO hadn’t key revenue driver brands take advantage participate in creating quality content participating social platforms. Content key great SEO cheap tactics like keyword stuffing cut more. Instead creating content people want read share works best. Andrew Girdwood. Modern SEO helpful. It less advertising tactic marketing strategy. Modern SEO involves creating working engaging content content good users want share discuss it. This boon users net creates upwards pressure quality. Rishi Lakhani. Competitive SEO actually helps make businesses even relevant searchers. Because know links naturally why. A page full carburettors sale may get links motivation But page shows clean carburettor will. The difference intent motivation differs it’s SEO community hard work encouraging content. SEO bad user Google’s pockets. There businesses spending big bucks SEO paid search using solid SEO techniques creating usable site filling great content small businesses rank higher bigger rivals. Andrew Girdwood. A strong example Modern SEO great users general emergence social CRM. Businesses increasing efforts look customers online using platforms like Twitter Google reach people bad experience brand encountered problem. This part due rise social also example Modern SEO. Google blogged back 2010 bad customers bad business. Customers benefit whenever brands take extra effort look convergence search social given business extra incentive that. Is real subtext statement gaff not As Rockway says thanks recent changes Plus' amount Google homepage real estate open influence SEO shrinking. So Google seeking minimise role SEO Rishi Lakhani feels strongly this. Of course bad approaches SEO. However attitude SEO=SPAM stop. Because biggest violators Google themselves. It takes content third party sites slowly wraps ads. Google gets short term partnerships businesses edge learn processes use build offering terminate relationships. Up years ago Google used use Yell supply local content. Now it’s overtaken Google Local. For years Google taking money credit card companies comparison sites alike.

Hi Graham I think timely article. SEO inherently bad diluting quality is. Some Rockway said bang money want rank highly Google relevant user currently searching. However positions opinion poorly.

It's money them I believe anymore focus user. The focus driving revenue think user achieve that. SEO innate thing can't bad people behind choosing whether follow good bad practice. So let's focus praise criticism people doing marketing discipline. thanks james. 2:01PM 8th February 2012. 1stly clever bait article guys. 2ndly. SEO spam.

Twitter buzzTweet. Print. Posted 09 February 2012 12:01pm dan barker 10 comments This post highlights simple useful feature that's crept onto UK's largest e-commerce sites last couple years real coverage. promo strip new slowly caught point almost standard high street retailers yet still fairly rare smaller sites. It's useful addition customer perspective informative without overbearing brand perspective orientated without overbearing!. There 12 examples below including variations central idea. Here's example basic version Play.com. That's it. A simple strip key information appears top navigation site performing roughly similar function direct mail Johnson Box. Sometimes promote key selling points site brand itself times highlight current promotions though really they're nice way display info want visitor site see. Below 11 examples trend. In screengrab promo strip highlighted green. There's theme among biggest retailers use strip delivery messaging. John Lewis promote delivery threshold collect delivery info along famous Knowingly Undersold'. Evans follow trend Delivery Returns information also include call action sign email list. Again Topshop opt UK Delivery delivery promo. House Fraser copycat John Lewis maybe way round collection' delivery' delivery promoted prominently here. And again Debenhams follows along Free Delivery store collection international delivery. Other standard delivery pick store' variations retailers who've gone little further. M&S step things nicely competitors showing international UK delivery info also highlighting current promotions area every site visitor see. M&S almost always sales areas site allows retailer flag everyone lands site. Another retailer showing delivery returns info Boux Avenue worth mention whereas retailers lumped promo strip top existing design Boux folded neatly overall look/theme site. Naked's version differs slightly others. Firstly navigation. Secondly introduces urgency deadline next XX minutes next day delivery call action. Penhaligon's fill area dead space layout delivery info also usefully heavily gifted brand promotes free gift wrapping service here. As Naked Wines Pen Heaven focuses urgency offering day engraving orders particular time. It also features customer reviews heavily here great smaller brand visitors may heard of. Kiddicare probably UK's leading baby product website. also leads way promo strip. First beats standard promos next day delivery hour slots. Second shows 365 day return policy. Third Kiddicare offers price match promise. Taking far further retailer added strips either side main content. These strips hidden smaller resolution 1024x768. For anyone larger monitor reinforce price match fast despatch also show many awards promote 119\,000 product reviews. As see popped place. They're simple addition highlight features info want show visitors. If run e-commerce site already tried this worth testing. If already running bog standard delivery worth trialing ideas see impact have. There nice extensions too personalising include discount codes depending traffic source etc. If willing A/B test it probably worth paying attention impact visitors first time buyers rather overall conversion rate. Do leave comment seen interesting examples this experience around results. Dan Barker E-Business Consultant guest blogger Econsultancy. Problems checkout process still biggest single source revenue loss e-commerce businesses. This report identifies 70 awesome recommendations includes lots practical insight help reduce checkout abandonment rates. Alternatively see The Future Digital Marketing 2010 Presentations E-commerce Platforms Buyer's Guide. Head Usability Conversion PRWD. 12:36PM 9th February 2012. Great article Dan highlighting something I talking presenting ideas last 12 months. The promo strip great example design pattern I seeing users actively engage user testing sessions. Your summary benefits feature spot too... useful addition customer perspective informative without overbearing brand perspective orientated without overbearing!). Picking Naked Wines example provided fact featured countdown timer since launched site superb way deliver persuasive technique sense urgency almost guarantee site visitors see even sub-consciously. A quick recommendation I make retailers implementing strips try cramming many messages space. If compare John Lewis Pen Heaven Kiddicare takes less effort scan latter two sites messages along using visual elements help differentiate messages. Thanks great post. E-Business Consultant Dan Barker. 12:54PM 9th February 2012. Thanks Paul And great advice. Interestingly I think Naked Wines design start. I could wrong I think original http://bit.ly/originalnw. I think makes nice point really useful test kind thing find works site audience business needs. Thanks again. dan. Senior Marketing Manager Personalisation MVT Tesco.com. 1:19PM 9th February 2012. Agree point quietly bubbling away many e-com sites without much focus. Very useful used right way. One thing I've seen contextualising personalising area pros cons associated used correctly could use profile data user first visit categories browsed etc provide persuasive prompting e.g. first time visitor provide generic deliver/returns/click collect/etc info start tailoring message visitor moves first time potential customer becoming customer etc.. within things fit brand male/female M&S example simply choosing whether display Men's Women's Trouser Offer. 1:31PM 9th February 2012. Great article Dan They fantastic examples persuading user without bombarding much information. I agree Paul scanning messages. How adding bit colour break different messages alongside leading text. Another great example ASOS really fantastic persuading customer journey. Ecommerce Director Eurosimm Ltd. 2:15PM 9th February 2012. Interesting see many retailers using bar promote delivery offerings. Perhaps customers familiar wider propositions need push choose us message. I'd advocate using bar push key USPs business particularly smaller less well known retailers fighting make mark. It would interesting see eye tracking studies survey people using sites featuring promo bars see content registers not. Given bar likely eyeline journey site I'd wager registers subconsciously even dont actively read it. Analyst CxFocus. 3:43PM 9th February 2012. Very interesting indeed. Thanks Dan.

Posted 09 February 2012 12:01pm dan barker 10 comments This post highlights simple useful feature that's crept onto UK's largest e-commerce sites last couple years real coverage. promo strip new slowly caught point almost standard high street retailers yet still fairly rare smaller sites. It's useful addition customer perspective informative without overbearing brand perspective orientated without overbearing!. There 12 examples below including variations central idea. Here's example basic version Play.com. That's it. A simple strip key information appears top navigation site performing roughly similar function direct mail Johnson Box. Sometimes promote key selling points site brand itself times highlight current promotions though really they're nice way display info want visitor site see. Below 11 examples trend. In screengrab promo strip highlighted green. There's theme among biggest retailers use strip delivery messaging. John Lewis promote delivery threshold collect delivery info along famous Knowingly Undersold'. Evans follow trend Delivery Returns information also include call action sign email list. Again Topshop opt UK Delivery delivery promo. House Fraser copycat John Lewis maybe way round collection' delivery' delivery promoted prominently here. And again Debenhams follows along Free Delivery store collection international delivery. Other standard delivery pick store' variations retailers who've gone little further. M&S step things nicely competitors showing international UK delivery info also highlighting current promotions area every site visitor see. M&S almost always sales areas site allows retailer flag everyone lands site. Another retailer showing delivery returns info Boux Avenue worth mention whereas retailers lumped promo strip top existing design Boux folded neatly overall look/theme site. Naked's version differs slightly others. Firstly navigation. Secondly introduces urgency deadline next XX minutes next day delivery call action. Penhaligon's fill area dead space layout delivery info also usefully heavily gifted brand promotes free gift wrapping service here. As Naked Wines Pen Heaven focuses urgency offering day engraving orders particular time. It also features customer reviews heavily here great smaller brand visitors may heard of. Kiddicare probably UK's leading baby product website. also leads way promo strip. First beats standard promos next day delivery hour slots. Second shows 365 day return policy. Third Kiddicare offers price match promise. Taking far further retailer added strips either side main content. These strips hidden smaller resolution 1024x768. For anyone larger monitor reinforce price match fast despatch also show many awards promote 119\,000 product reviews. As see popped place. They're simple addition highlight features info want show visitors. If run e-commerce site already tried this worth testing. If already running bog standard delivery worth trialing ideas see impact have. There nice extensions too personalising include discount codes depending traffic source etc. If willing A/B test it probably worth paying attention impact visitors first time buyers rather overall conversion rate. Do leave comment seen interesting examples this experience around results. Dan Barker E-Business Consultant guest blogger Econsultancy. Problems checkout process still biggest single source revenue loss e-commerce businesses. This report identifies 70 awesome recommendations includes lots practical insight help reduce checkout abandonment rates. Alternatively see The Future Digital Marketing 2010 Presentations E-commerce Platforms Buyer's Guide. Head Usability Conversion PRWD. 12:36PM 9th February 2012. Great article Dan highlighting something I talking presenting ideas last 12 months. The promo strip great example design pattern I seeing users actively engage user testing sessions. Your summary benefits feature spot too... useful addition customer perspective informative without overbearing brand perspective orientated without overbearing!). Picking Naked Wines example provided fact featured countdown timer since launched site superb way deliver persuasive technique sense urgency almost guarantee site visitors see even sub-consciously. A quick recommendation I make retailers implementing strips try cramming many messages space. If compare John Lewis Pen Heaven Kiddicare takes less effort scan latter two sites messages along using visual elements help differentiate messages. Thanks great post. E-Business Consultant Dan Barker. 12:54PM 9th February 2012. Thanks Paul And great advice. Interestingly I think Naked Wines design start. I could wrong I think original http://bit.ly/originalnw. I think makes nice point really useful test kind thing find works site audience business needs. Thanks again. dan. Senior Marketing Manager Personalisation MVT Tesco.com. 1:19PM 9th February 2012. Agree point quietly bubbling away many e-com sites without much focus. Very useful used right way. One thing I've seen contextualising personalising area pros cons associated used correctly could use profile data user first visit categories browsed etc provide persuasive prompting e.g. first time visitor provide generic deliver/returns/click collect/etc info start tailoring message visitor moves first time potential customer becoming customer etc.. within things fit brand male/female M&S example simply choosing whether display Men's Women's Trouser Offer. 1:31PM 9th February 2012. Great article Dan They fantastic examples persuading user without bombarding much information. I agree Paul scanning messages. How adding bit colour break different messages alongside leading text. Another great example ASOS really fantastic persuading customer journey. Ecommerce Director Eurosimm Ltd. 2:15PM 9th February 2012. Interesting see many retailers using bar promote delivery offerings. Perhaps customers familiar wider propositions need push choose us message. I'd advocate using bar push key USPs business particularly smaller less well known retailers fighting make mark. It would interesting see eye tracking studies survey people using sites featuring promo bars see content registers not. Given bar likely eyeline journey site I'd wager registers subconsciously even dont actively read it. Analyst CxFocus. 3:43PM 9th February 2012. Very interesting indeed. Thanks Dan.

I've talking Product Director Trinity Mirror Econsultancy guest blogger Malcolm Coles thinking behind new site design. Why relaunched site. The old website around several years old content management system. We wanted give journalists modern tool publish work also needed new platform would enable us integrate social media effectively. Now new CMS we’re trying new technology personalised news suggestions London-based startup Rummble Labs. What main goals new site We aim increase number pages viewed per visit user features personalised recommendations help us achieve this. Another aim showcase great photography old site. That one plenty photos didn’t really provide space show properly. Now journalists add metadata posts great photos given prominence. We also wanted fewer ad slots make appealing therefore valuable users. We're definitely going paywall route. Also comments open articles default opposite used be hope encourage people stick around leave views. They’ll stories though legal reasons every single one. How handle comments We use latest version Pluck built-in moderation tools post-moderate comments part relying readers flag inappropriate comments. How personalisation work The old site relatively cluttered though promoted lot stories thr homepage I think gave people less idea look go site. Before launching version spent lot time working help people find want. People tend snack news sites maybe browsing breaks lunch hours on personalisation helps find something interest them. The technology learn articles people choose read browse site recommend reading list right hand side articles. These based user’s viewing history recommend stories based this people liked article also liked. In addition users sign Facebook logins receive recommendations based interests. Recommended news pulls list 30 year old woman interest celebrity sees something different 40 year old Arsenal supporting man. One thing I noticed new site drop menus. These common e-commerce less news sites. Yes e-commerce sites increasingly used way allowing people see section glance quickly access product pages deep site. In way provide users shortcut main stories menu well allowing see top stories section glance. Now launched new site continue test tweak. With previous redesign 2008) launched nothing much changed that. There lot user testing relaunching version site we’ll using lots MVT go on well learning works doesn’t web analytics data. Which sections people use most navigate around site on. We’ll able make changes improve increase usage site. Have relaunched mobile site too What proportion traffic comes channel Yes we've also launched m.mirror.co.uk mobile site built HTML5.

The business leaders economists gathered World Economic Forum recently Davos Switzerland find data behind startling comparisons Forumâ€TMs 500-page Travel Tourism Competitiveness Report.

Switzerland certainly pretty good. Itâ€TMs beautiful country takes excellent care itself. Coincidentally of) itâ€TMs home Davos. Is appealing nation Earth Itâ€TMs without wrinkles. The Swiss franc soared high stratosphereâ€”at least Swiss tied euroâ€”that people couldnâ€TMt afford visiting average restaurant meal two could run $200. Not competitive that. Otherwise though Switzerland reasonable winner. At end scale\,it’s surprise either impoverished refugee-laden Chad anchors bottom No. 139. The U.S. way comes strong number 6 despite bombing ease-of-entry. try get visa.. But Forumâ€TMs report contains bizarre results too. The scores composite 14 different categories sub-scores donâ€TMt always add up. How be The answer lies use metricsâ€”that is report relies things count. The ranking system based partly CEO interview results heavily set quantifiable indicators. Hong Kong instance high percentage tiny land area protection comes looking greener Ireland. New Zealandâ€TMs vulnerable island ecosystem records worldâ€TMs highest rate threatened speciesâ€”probably New Zealand actually bothered record themâ€”but bad number knocks one worldâ€TMs conservation-minded nations downward ranking. Why care Because governments investors make decisions based part report decisions might improve destination ruin it. Stewardship Ease Business. For comparison look National Geographic rankings destinations published annually National Geographic Traveler 2004 2010. We avoided quantifiable measuresâ€”how quantify scenic beauty cultural integrity?â€”and based surveys solely hundreds expert opinions destinationâ€TMs condition.

We looking sustainability Davos economics. But two relate. In long run place canâ€TMt succeed one without other. The National Geographic surveys polled opinions experts stewardship bias. The Forum polls business executives presumably economic profit bias. Legitimate perceptions two different directions. The trouble begins conflict. A higher score Forum categories may actually hurt destination quality. Ease business competitive pricing instance may mask lax environmental protection free-fire zones slapdash developers. Heavy cruise ship traffic sprawling vacation subdivisions dampen stewardship scores economic metrics like infrastructure may encourage overdevelopment. Tourism known fouling nest. The destination spoils growing rancid crust asphalt fast-food franchises. Quantify vs. Qualify Then arithmetic issues. The report assign Switzerland bottom-hugging 127 pricing competitiveness cost-of-trip decision-maker many tourists apparently gets weight Index formula 13 categories. While many numerical measures used report fine others bit weird. The Culture category counts history terms countryâ€TMs UNESCO-listed World Heritage sites. No protected historic places districtsâ€”too hard find quantify. No museums theaters performance venues either. The researchers tried data’s there. What easy count Sport stadium seats No kidding. In Davos economics one-fifth weighting nationâ€TMs cultural-resource score based stadium capacity. That might make sense Texas Italy. The Human Resources category includes several general-education measuresâ€”fineâ€”but measure local employment tourism business tour guides innkeepers restaurant staffs. No reasonable way get data. But one factor Index count is um HIV prevalence. Just sort tourism assessing here. Those oddities necessarily fault researchers burned much late-night oil get huge report done. Indeed welcome suggestions better measures. Itâ€TMs framing task first place. For example quantitative data usually tabulated political jurisdictions. Deal 139 them itâ€TMs virtually impossible get meaningful comparisons international stew varying definitions methods accuracy. If statistically desperate youâ€TMre tempted grab whatever data available. To paraphrase oft-forgotten observation The quantifiable necessarily meaningful meaningful always quantifiable. We donâ€TMt want economic political leaders basing decisions favorite destinations foundation quantified mush. Probably travel tourism hasnâ€TMt foremost minds money-barons gathered Davos though constitute measures one worldâ€TMs top three industries.Â And country I personally love foremost minds Greece. Gorgeous Greece become worrisomeÂ visit. Its debt crisis black hole economic cosmos sucking massive clouds euros hope. Are protests strikes come. Greece scores robust 29 139 tourism competitiveness.

Help customers find helpful reviewsÂ Was review helpful you?Â Besides 12 original albums set includes 5-track bonus disc notable rockin rendition Emotion absolutely beautiful version On symphony!. These two excellent remakes couple Aerosmith’s best songs. The great thing set old albums appear exactly originally they’ve remastered. You don’t worry song selection it’s here. So anyone wanting start good Aerosmith collection absolute best place start. This box set highly recommended. Don’t let high price tag fool you–it’s well worth every penny. Was review helpful you?Â A lot reviewers seem clueless box set released way was. Some history might clear up. Aerosmith first signed Columbia records 1972. Then mid 1980s cleaned drug habits switched labels Geffen records. After quite successful come-back went back Columbia records 1994. What box set Well realize music industry release compilations box sets even re-releases older albums largely determined band’s record label. A record label obviously isn’t going make money album put another label. This means band releases lot albums one record label leaves new label label handle things best interest mind. For example old stuff might get acquired re-released by new label band try finish old contract releasing compilation album etc. It’s coincidence Aerosmith joined back Columbia 1994 label decided re-release 12 albums done Aerosmith. In addition selling separately also decided put 12 discs box set Fire. So box set simply contains 12 individual Aerosmith albums released Columbia records plus bonus EP rarities. This means NOT find anything albums Aerosmith Geffen. That means nothing With Mirrors” Vacation” Grip. If you’re looking compilation hit songs years try Ones” Geffen released year. But WILL find Fire”. DISCS 1-7 Aerosmith’s 7 albums 1970s. Your Wings” Attic” Line” Bootleg live album Ruts. DISC 8 Hits” compilation spanning 1970s albums released 1980. DISC 9 The 1982 album Hard Place. This made without Joe Perry often considered black sheep album Aerosmith’s career. Personally I love it. DISCS 10-11 Live! Live II. These two live compilation albums Columbia released Aerosmith still making new albums Geffen. The first collection 1977-1983 recordings bonus non-album track Barbara. Classics II consists live recordings mid-80s Aerosmith reunited Joe Perry. DISC 12 another album Columbia released Aerosmith already Geffen cash-in band’s return popularity due hits releasing Geffen albums like Vacation It released 1988 essentially Hits volume II Columbia years. I remember quite popular cheap way new Aerosmith fans get older stuff disc could get studio version Away Stone” 1978 single never released track full album before. DISC 13 This bonus EP five tracks. There’s 1991 edit Emotion” Columbia used music video promote Box box set yet ANOTHER thing released Aerosmith success Geffen records. Also live orchestral version On band Mtv special also released Action Hero soundtrack. The tree tracks Jerk ghost track Box” two songs won’t find anywhere else. Some people complaining redundant tracks fact could use less discs fit music. Again re-release 12 individual Aerosmith albums sold individually anyway they’re sold together collector’s set. They’re going completeness. So would want buy entire box set Especially since admittedly redundant tracks Hits” etc. If you’re casual fan means stick much cheaper Box box set Columbia released 1991. On hand don’t much Aerosmith CD best way get old stuff one purchase one low price. That certainly case many us back 1994 lot us Aerosmith vinyl cassette wanted good CD replacement. Likewise you’re die-hard fan wants complete collection including rarities then... Read more. Was review helpful you?Â By far comprehensive Aerosmith collection available. Box Fire includes band’s Columbia albums exception of course Nine Lives even adds 5 cd bonus disc. The discs come remastered extensive linear notes. The drawback excellent box set price. At around $100 much listeners loaded definately get collection especially don’t already albums. If though almost certainly want pass nothing new outside five songs probably already heard maybe even own three box itself. Was review helpful you?Â You must logged post comment.

I recently bought paintball mask read lot reviews bought it people said fogged said didn’t don’t like look mask petty personal opinion dislikes. I writing review performance mask looks. I live St.Louis muggy humid city first day I used mask 90 degrees humid I playing woodsball lot running sliding dodging. first I would like say mask DID NOT FOG AT ALL I 28 years old wear glasses mask comfortable felt nice I almost didn’t even know I wearing it I problems features mask AT ALL. Bottom line around GREAT mask I would recommend anyone looking great mask fits good fits good glasses trim foam fits better don’t looks good fog doesn’t cost arm leg short BUY THIS MASK! Its AWESOME!!!! Help customers find helpful reviewsÂ Was review helpful you?Â Was review helpful you?Â I used rent goggles fields WOW buying pair DEFINITELY worth money people shooting SEE them priceless. goggles large viewable range lens doesn’t fog easy all. It comfortable proven durability. beginner perfect. Was review helpful you?Â pros flexible durable hard plastic. excellent view fogging.. cons foam pinches nose little bit basically breathe mouth. need find way fix that. Was review helpful you?Â The standard tippmann A-5 big bulky hard see around shooting usually biggest thing gets shot head. The low profile hopper great eliminates problems it’s rectangular shape sits way lower gun unblocking iron sights. also holds amount stock hopper maybe even couple more. hopper great looking efficient battle feild want gun look good. Was review helpful you?Â This came A5. In comparison standard gravity hopper thing awesome! Your marker actually feels like gun without bulky plastic thing top. Very durable rugged.

UFC 143 Medical Suspensions Carlos Condit Among 15 Fighters Suspended. Post navigation. Archives. Meta. By Brad Walker MMATorch Contributor Here’s works I going look number factors affect value title currently held defended inside UFC. I list factors pros cons numbers behind title lead final score level prestige comes winning title compared others numerical value title scale 1 100. UFC Heavyweight Championship Created February 7 1997 First Champion Mark Hammer Coleman Total Number Of Reigns 16 Including Interim Titles Most Reigns 2 Couture Times Successfully Defended 12 Longest Reign 1\,113 Days Couture The Heavyweight Title generally considered prestigious fighting regardless organization in. I understand consensus behind that I don’t necessarily agree it. Many top level competitors held belt including Bas Rutten Randy Couture Tim Sylvia Brock Lesnar Frank Mir. It clearly held number current future hall famers certainly adds shine gold. I think dominant champion would probably considered Brock Lesnar came saw conquered defended twice tie record defenses. Given factors removing general field thought numbers speak volumes title. Although 16 undisputed champions title defended successfully 12 times. This means defending heavyweight champion 25 chance losing belt first defense decrease 20 count interim reigns. It certainly one hardest titles hold onto increasingly dangerous division belt certainly lends serious swagger holder. Total Value Out Of 100 86 It’s hard title win it’s even harder title keep definitely increases value. It considered sought title UFC good reason means you’re biggest baddest scariest guy world mixed martial arts. That doesn’t mean actual value increased that’s I put 86 it’s definitely title everyone wants also title get match it reasonable chance getting it. UFC Light-Heavyweight Championship Created December 21 1997 First Champion Frank Shamrock Total Number Of Reigns 12 Counting Interim Most Reigns 3 Couture Times Successfully Defended 17 Longest Reign 1\,260 Days Ortiz This title fantastic history originally called middleweight title renamed 2001 adoption unified rules. A large majority time spent around waist current future hall famers perhaps title UFC. I many fond memories defenses feuds went along them notably Chuck Liddell Tito Ortiz. There number times I believed title would never change hands instance Rampage belt I figured guy’s monster. Fate funny way moving title way could funnier Forrest Griffin’s leg kick domination Rampage. Some title reigns feeling like flukes affect value title I believe stands champion absolute monster like Jon Jones serve raise value. Total Value Out Of 100 78 I low 78 hard past champions fallen. Chuck Tito Forrest become afterthoughts world MMA it’s best clearly past respective primes. The fact it’s highly defended certainly brought number quite bit Jon Jones hands belt holding throne I would expect see great increase next year two. UFC Middleweight Championship Created September 28 2001 First Champion Dave Menne Total Number Of Reigns 5 Most Reigns Nobody held title twice Times Successfully Defended 12 Longest Reign 1\,939 Days Silva It certainly works title’s favor best pound pound fighter world wearing around waist five years now. He clearly dominant champion UFC history adds large amount value belt. Sure people look name Dave Menne go heck that? And I don’t blame guy truly after-thought MMA world that’s fault inaugural champion all. The title started gaining value Rich Franklin took Evan Tanner 2005 ever since hardest title get hands on. Did I mention Anderson Silva best fighter planet probably retire holding belt In 10 years existence belt five champions recent owner half lifespan This hardest attain belt mixed martial arts right now good reason champion considered MMA royalty. Total Value Out Of 100 97 The thing could raise value belt first two champions erased record start title history fighter like Evan Tanner. When Evan Tanner passed away 2008 felt gone flat inside cage lose title Rich Franklin future hall famer. This belt doesn’t lengthy history others do that’s exactly it’s coveted belt world. UFC Welterweight Championship Created October 16th 1998 First Champion Pat Miletich Total Number Of Reigns 8 counting Interim belts Most Reigns 2 GSP Matt Hughes Times Successfully Defended 17 Longest Reign 1\,363 Days This title almost exclusively held current future members UFC Hall Fame exception Carlos Newton Matt Serra. Starting Pat Miletich moving Georges St-Pierre title waist greatest fighters MMA history. GSP clearly second best pound pound fighter world since regaining title 2008 showed unmatched brilliance inside cage. Between GSP Hughes Miletich every title defense ever history belt. B.J. Penn also notably held title 2004 stripped making jump K-1. There lot controversy around belt I don’t currently believe anyone division going get current champ anytime soon. If winds hands Nick Diaz Carlos Condit one done type reign value drop. Total Value Out Of 100 89 The fact GSP looks like vulnerable champion right two solid contenders left division took away overall points division although top tier looks little crowded isn’t deep could be St-Pierre already beaten almost anybody could fight title aside Diaz Condit possibly Johny Hendricks. I expect see around waist GSP couple years someone manages take away. UFC Lightweight Championship Created Feb 23 2001 First Champion Jens Pulver Total Number Of Reigns 4 Most Reigns Nobody held title twice Times Successfully Defended 8 1 draw. Longest Reign 812 Days Penn This title kind odd history first champion stripped title four man tournament held ended draw. It left vacant 2006 captured Sean Sherk turn stripped title testing positive steroids. After things kind evened B.J. Penn taking title prominence Frankie Edgar also lending hand value. I don’t know I believe Edgar still champion UFC 144 bout Ben Henderson things lightweight division really churning right now. There many powerful prospects top notch contenders lying wait shot belt. Total Value Out Of 100 65 There many stains history belt it’s hard give promising value. It stripped first two champions B.J. Penn’s downfall hasn’t exactly added value legitimacy past champions. I would love see truly dominant fighter get hands belt defend years end like GSP Silva belts. That way get overall value title increased I know Frankie Edgar could guy take title 80′s 90′s value stands get past Benson Henderson first. I going wait months evaluate Featherweight Bantamweight Flyweight titles history beginning. follow twitter I always taking requests writing topics love hear comments columns.

UFC Welterweight Championship Created October 16th 1998 First Champion Pat Miletich Total Number Of Reigns 8 counting Interim belts Most Reigns 2 GSP Matt Hughes Times Successfully Defended 17 Longest Reign 1\,363 Days This title almost exclusively held current future members UFC Hall Fame exception Carlos Newton Matt Serra. Starting Pat Miletich moving Georges St-Pierre title waist greatest fighters MMA history. GSP clearly second best pound pound fighter world since regaining title 2008 showed unmatched brilliance inside cage. Between GSP Hughes Miletich every title defense ever history belt. B.J. Penn also notably held title 2004 stripped making jump K-1. There lot controversy around belt I don’t currently believe anyone division going get current champ anytime soon. If winds hands Nick Diaz Carlos Condit one done type reign value drop. Total Value Out Of 100 89 The fact GSP looks like vulnerable champion right two solid contenders left division took away overall points division although top tier looks little crowded isn’t deep could be St-Pierre already beaten almost anybody could fight title aside Diaz Condit possibly Johny Hendricks. I expect see around waist GSP couple years someone manages take away. UFC Lightweight Championship Created Feb 23 2001 First Champion Jens Pulver Total Number Of Reigns 4 Most Reigns Nobody held title twice Times Successfully Defended 8 1 draw. Longest Reign 812 Days Penn This title kind odd history first champion stripped title four man tournament held ended draw. It left vacant 2006 captured Sean Sherk turn stripped title testing positive steroids. After things kind evened B.J. Penn taking title prominence Frankie Edgar also lending hand value. I don’t know I believe Edgar still champion UFC 144 bout Ben Henderson things lightweight division really churning right now. There many powerful prospects top notch contenders lying wait shot belt. Total Value Out Of 100 65 There many stains history belt it’s hard give promising value. It stripped first two champions B.J. Penn’s downfall hasn’t exactly added value legitimacy past champions. I would love see truly dominant fighter get hands belt defend years end like GSP Silva belts. That way get overall value title increased I know Frankie Edgar could guy take title 80′s 90′s value stands get past Benson Henderson first. I going wait months evaluate Featherweight Bantamweight Flyweight titles history beginning. follow twitter I always taking requests writing topics love hear comments columns.

Earlier week House Representatives approved H.R. 535 nonbinding resolution designating 2012 Bible.â Introduced Rep. Rick Saccone Township 36 legislators measure insists teachings inspired concepts civil government contained Declaration Independence Constitution United States.â. This resolution sends clear message residents state favors Christianity thus violates spirit First Amendment U.S. Constitution. It also runs afoul Section 3 Pennsylvania State Constitution states preference shall ever given law religious establishments modes worship.â Section 3 makes crystal clear Pennsylvaniaâ€TMs early representatives recognized importance keeping church state separated intended government remain neutral respect religion. This resolution also alienating effect informing non-Christians little second-class citizens. According data 2000 Penn State Universityâ€TMs Association Religion Data Archives shows Pennsylvaniaâ€TMs population 12\,281\,054. Of these 8\,448\,193 estimated belong sort organized religionâ 422\,000 non-Christian. This leaves around 4 million residents whose religious affiliations unknown. A 2011 Gallup Poll found 7 Americans claim atheist similar studies. Using 7 conservative approximation means 4 million whose religious affiliations unknown 280\,000 considered atheist. These data suggest 700\,000 non-Christian atheist Pennsylvania residents probably agree H.R. 535. Added number would Christians also believe majority religion forced upon non-Christians. Many Christians solemnly believe religion personal endeavor religious edicts heralded state houses. If church-state separation means anything all ought stand proposition government stays religion. Many Americans believe Bible many donâ€TMt. Itâ€TMs business Pennsylvania House make overt religious proclamations. Itâ€TMs shame House turned back admirable tradition government neutrality respect religion sent message intolerance share majority faith. Name Email Website. Comment. Copyright 2012 DVAU.

His humor ability walk us case one step time brought home extent 1954 addition G-d pledge violates First amendment. The purpose addition clear teach children young age loyalty country synonymous loyalty G-d.It clearly endorses one religion another Buddhist every recitation pledge violates duty speech” public school teacher I attest classes students coerced saying pledge. What I never fathomed side could defend G-d pledge constitutionally. The answer clear end presentation. They don’t. Some arguments that phrase acknowledged limited government Declaration NOT Constitution Promotes Patriotism commemorates role religion American History included Texas SS textbooks I’m sure need look pledge entirety G-d. None reasons really argues courts support Congress’s inclusion G-d 1954 revision pledge still held Constitutional. In 2008 Sarah Palin asked offended phrase God Pledge Allegiance Why not?. Her reply disturbing us believe teaching history accurately life. If good enough founding fathers good enough I’ll fight defense Pledge Allegiance..

DontVoteDontComplain. February 10 2012 1:00 pm. Both ladies put better sounding material recent duet wasn’t supported. Now taking route many urban artists recording music appeal pop audience. If don’t support favorite artists put quality music don’t surprised start putting music appeal audiences. Mark words song top pop charts time. LALA Reply:February 10th 2012 1:19 pm. Picking Rico hit miss honest. But poster said singers going pop more...unfortunately SO true. Moreover labels tend support singers that. RCA hasnt show interest Monica’s project promotion THIS song def pop r&b. I wish much success albums marriage/relationships. Say word. February 10 2012 1:13 pm. Love em both!
